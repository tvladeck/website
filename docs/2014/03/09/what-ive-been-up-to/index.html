<div id="post">
<p>February was a crazy travel month. I packed trips to Casablanca, DC, Tahoe, London, and Venice (and not to mention the airports of Chicago, New York, Paris, Brussels, and Frankfurt) into the span of 31 Jan to 2 March.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been thinking about insurance and risk. It’s funny when things you’ve worked on a while ago and since discarded pop back into your life. Three and a half years ago I wrote <a href="http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Thesis.pdf" target="_blank">my master’s thesis</a> on the relationship between insurance, climate change, and capital investment. Somewhat randomly I was asked to put together a short paper on this topic for <a href="http://newclimateeconomy.net/" target="_blank">New Climate Economy</a>, where I am a Senior Programme Officer, where I’ll get the chance to show off some of the ideas that I developed.</p>

<p>The gist is that since insurance markets clear annually (a little bit longer for some reinsurance contracts), exposure to long-term risks (like climate change), can’t be traded with existing insurance instruments. Weather is a draw from a distribution, whereas climate is the distribution itself.</p>

<p>So in many regions there is an acute risk that premia will rise substantially in the future. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/nyregion/cost-of-coastal-living-to-climb-under-new-flood-rules.html" target="_blank">This already happened on the East Coast of the US after Sandy</a>. But this risk can’t be transferred, since no forward / futures markets exist for insurance.</p>

<p>In the end there are two reasons this is of concern: First, the lack of a market for this risk means that those holding it can’t dispose of it directly, and may be unequipped to handle it. The premia for, say, windstorm insurance for a residence could rise so substantially that it becomes unaffordable, or that this rise in prices causes a substantial hit to the home equity value.</p>

<p>The second concern is that a lack of pricing for this risk causes a distorted investment picture, and not only will there be no risk cover for those ultimately affected, but <b>the absence of a signal on future risks causes even more people and property to be exposed to them</b>.</p>

<p>So that’s what I’ve been doing and thinking about. À bientôt!</p>
