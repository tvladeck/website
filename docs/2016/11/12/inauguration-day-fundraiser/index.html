    <h1>Inauguration Day Fundraiser</h1>

<div id="post">
<p><em>I sent this email to a group of my friends that live in NYC. If you live in the area and want to help organize, let me know at thomas.vladeck@gmail.com</em></p>

<p>Friends,</p>

<p>If you’re like me you’re shocked about what happened on election day. I can’t believe our country decided to put that orange-skinned, pussy-grabbing, bankrupt con artist that’s likely an agent of the Russian government into the Oval Office.</p>

<p>But here we are.</p>

<p>As bad as it is now, he’s not in office yet. And as unpredictable as he is, we have no idea what to expect he’ll do when he gets there (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uhpo1jrj4nt6d2f/Screenshot%202016-11-12%2011.40.26.png?dl=0">see these two back-to-back tweets as he does a real-time A/B test of governing styles</a>), but it likely won’t be good. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/14/politics/newt-gingrich-house-un-american-activities-committee/">One of his top lieutenants already proposed bringing back the House Un-American Activities Committee</a> (a black stain on the history of American Civil Liberties), and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/if-donald-trump-implements-his-proposed-policies-well-see-him-court">if he implements his campaign proposals to remove 11 million immigrants, ban muslims, punish women for having abortions, reinstate waterboarding, and change our libel and slander laws - he’ll be violating the first, fourth, fifth, eighth, and 14th amendments</a>.</p>

<p>Not to mention <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-36401174">he’s planning to rip up the watershed Paris Accords</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en">makes sense as Climate Change is a Chinese hoax…</a>) <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/climate-trends-continue-to-break-records">in a year that has seen every indicator of Global Warming reach dizzying new heights</a>.</p>

<p>While we’re on the subject of existential threats, it’s becoming clear where the <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/22/michael-morell/experts-say-donald-trumps-policies-dovetail-what-v/">suspiciously pro-Russia policies of the Trump campaign</a> came from, as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/moscow-had-contacts-with-trump-team-during-campaign-russian-diplomat-says/2016/11/10/28fb82fa-a73d-11e6-9bd6-184ab22d218e_story.html">Russian diplomats had been in contact with the Trump campaign throughout</a>. This at a time that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/nato-ground-troops-high-alert-russia-tensions-baltic-latvia-lithuania-estonia-a7402136.html">NATO has put <b>three hundred thousand</b> ground troops on high alert</a> because of a feared confrontation with Russia.</p>

<p>I don’t know about you, but I’m probably going to be a wreck on inauguration day (January 20th). Instead of just watching, let’s do something. And that something we should do is <b>party together</b>, raising money for organizations that are going to fight these abhorrences tooth and nail.</p>

<p>Here’s what I’m thinking:</p>
<ul>
	<li>We rent out a space</li>
	<li>We invite all our friends</li>
	<li>We have a great time</li>
	<li>Some great groups get some needed cash to keep the fight going</li>
</ul>
<p>Who’s in?</p>

<p>Tom</p>
