<p class="has-drop-cap">Like many Americans, I have watched with some amazement at the rise of AOC and other forces on the left, often under the guise of "socialism". </p>

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But does anyone know what it means?
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>‚ÄúSocialism‚Äù has come to confuse two different things:
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->

<ol><li>A form of economy: State or collective ownership of the "means of production", meaning government planning and control</li><li>Policy aims: income redistribution, state subsidies to reduce poverty, government provision of healthcare</li></ol>

<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And boy, are these extremely different. Consider, the classic book <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="The Road to Serfdom (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Serfdom#The_role_of_government" target="_blank">The Road to Serfdom</a></em>, which argued that a planned economy (socialist under definition [1] above) would invariably lead to a loss of freedoms, also contained explicit exceptions for the <em>policy aims</em> of a welfare state, so long as it was done within the context of a capitalist economy.

<p>But is this true? At the time I wrote that tweet, I didn‚Äôt have any data to back up my assertion ‚Äî I had just recently read <em>The Road to Serfdom</em> so I had a fairly good idea at how socialism was viewed then; and I follow the political discourse so had an intuition about how it‚Äôs viewed today. Turns out, according to <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/243362/meaning-socialism-americans-today.aspx">Gallup data from 1949 and today</a>, that my intuition was luckily right.

<p>Why does this matter? You might, like me, strenuously object to any movement towards socialism if it meant collective control of the economy while being comfortable with a welfare state. But the muddled definition of socialism out there does not help people draw lines effectively. According to the graph above, most people think of socialism as a set of policy aims; whereas most die-hards view socialism as a different form of economy. That can lead to this kind of confusion:
<!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<div class="jekyll-twitter-plugin"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">and here is the socialist party defining socialism with the definition people no longer associate with socialism in response to a tweet that nobody truly understands what socialism means...<br /><br />üò¨ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è <a href="https://t.co/qBzulp11B1">https://t.co/qBzulp11B1</a></p>&mdash; tom vladeck ‚ñΩ‚û´ (@tvladeck) <a href="https://twitter.com/tvladeck/status/1102294506152620033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 3, 2019</a></blockquote>
