<p>David Brooks writes a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/opinion/brooks-a-sad-green-story.html?src=me&amp;ref=general&amp;_r=0">thoughtful article</a> today on the Obama administration&#8217;s attempts to spur innovation in clean technology, and he recites a common fallacy in the environmental policy space. Namely, that the problem of technological substitution can be solved through market-price corrections alone. This is why he laments the subsidies granted to early-stage technology firms and pines for a carbon tax instead. </p>
<p>One can bucket mitigation technologies into roughly three groups. Imagine that there is a cost curve in front of you, like the McKinsey curve, with the cost of each technology on the y-axis, and the amount of mitigation opportunity on the x-axis. Imagine that these technologies are ordered from left to right, lowest to highest cost.</p>
<p>There are two important horizontal lines to draw through this graph. The first is at y = 0. It&#8217;s hard to beleive, but there are mitigation technologies that actually pay for themselves, and then some. These technologies are negative cost. There a host of reasons that they don&#8217;t get deployed / implemented; let&#8217;s call these policy issues &#8220;Barriers". The first thing to understand is that since these already are profitable, it&#8217;s not clear that a price correction will solve the underlying issue. Perhaps making them even more profitable will do the trick, but perhaps not.</p>
<p>Now imagine that we agree that there is a social cost of each ton of CO2-equivalent; let&#8217;s call this cost SCC (the social cost of carbon). The next important line is at y = SCC. If you implemented a cap-and-trade or carbon-tax scheme, presumably all the mitigation opportunity below this line would be implemented. Let&#8217;s call these policy issues &#8220;Incentives". </p>
<p>Finally, there are opportunities above the y = SCC line. These technologies would not be implemented even with a market price on carbon, because they are too expensive. The aim of policies targeting these technologies should be to bring the cost down to below the y = SCC line, or to &#8220;bend the curve", so to speak. Let&#8217;s call this group &#8220;Innovation". Now, you could argue that establishing a price on carbon would incentivize entrpreneurs to bring the cost of these technologies down, but that argument works for any price on carbon, even 0 (i.e., there is always an incentive to bring the cost of technologies below the incumbent).</p>
<p>Knowing that the speed of cost reduction at y = 0 has not been what we need, and not knowing what it would be at y = SCC, it makes intuitive sense to tackle the cost reduction problem directly for technologies that are at y &gt; SCC. </p>
