    <h1>Being your own customer</h1>
</div>

<div id="post">
<p>Recently I’ve been idly thinking about companies that have the good fortune of being their own customer. I think this is an extremely valuable place to be, because it gives you the best possible insight into your product, and insulates you from losing touch with your product’s market.</p>

<p>Some examples I think of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Salesforce's use of their own CRM product with a team of salespeople that sell their product. Not only do they get great feedback on their own product, but the fact that they have a best-in-breed sales team is great marketing itself, and they get to be a thought leader in their space.</li>
	<li>I bet Dropbox and Box use their own file-sharing services internally. By doing this, they get great insight into how a corporate might use their product and what features they'd need. Same with Evernote and Google Apps.</li>
</ul>
<p>I wonder though, if this is possible only for B2B (or even more narrowly, enterprise) products. Can consumer-product companies be their own customers. Of course their employees can; but is that enough?</p>
