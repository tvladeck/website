   <title>Conservatism</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A buddy of mine said in a group chat that he was surprised that me and another friend had become conservatives, after being so liberal while in college. I joked back that it must have been business school that did us in, since we both went.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My serious answer was that a few things had changed my outlook:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paying a huge amount in shadow taxes, to the point where it will actually prevent me from hiring at least one person in the future, made me reconsider the role of taxes and the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reading the Strategy of Conflict made me a hawk on foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living through the debacle of Trump, and watching our slow-motion train wreck on the health care debate (Obamacare passed! Will it survive a court challenge? It was repealed! Not all the way, though! It’ll get repealed next time! Will it survive another court challenge?), gave me a new perspective on federalism.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;taxes&quot;&gt;Taxes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the sole owner of an LLC, every dollar of the company’s income is my income, so I pay taxes on it, regardless of what I do with it, even if I leave it in the company. I could elect to have it taxed differently, paying corporate taxes and taking a salary – but that would mean even more taxes, regardless of how I used the money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My goal with Gradient is to grow it to be very large, and eventually to employ a lot of people. To that end, I leave most income in the company, to use as working capital and to fuel growth (we haven’t raised a dime from anyone). My &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; income is much less than Gradient’s income, but I pay taxes on it all the same. The amount of taxes I’ve paid is more than the salary of at least two qualified junior programmers or one very senior data scientist. I could be creating good, lucrative
jobs for people, but I can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying my taxes should be lower, I’m just saying that seeing the tradeoff first hand has at least educated me that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a tradeoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;foreign-policy&quot;&gt;Foreign Policy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We dare not tempt them with weakness” - JFK&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all share the goal of less war, less bloodshed, and more peace on Earth. Let’s start there. Advocating a strong military does not by itself mean that you’re somehow more accepting of tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument is about the &lt;em&gt;means&lt;/em&gt; to an end, not the end itself, and I believe that American military superiority – as overwhelmingly dominant as we can sustain for as long as we can sustain it – is the best path for peace. We can’t just wish war away, because not everyone will wish along with us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;federalism&quot;&gt;Federalism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I explained this in a different post, but the bottom line is that America is a big country. There is a lot of stuff that we don’t agree on, like health care. Why should we have to? We have states for a reason – let’s  use them! Let Utah have a conservative system and Massachusetts have a liberal system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One issue is that the size of the federal government (see above) gives states less wiggle room to do their own thing. Any expansion of state power would come on top of the federal government. I don’t think that the absolute size of the federal government should change, but I do think that many of its functions should move to the state level. As I wrote previously I think that this – in the past and currently – has unfortunately been tightly integrated with racism and civil
rights, so consider everything I write above to be modulo that proviso.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing to consider is that with more local control we truly have a domestic government that is antifragile. Uncertainty and random variation, in this case, is our friend. To the extent that something works in Idaho, people can vote with their feet or vote in the normal sense. With a powerful federal government, it’s the opposite case. We have one shot on goal.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Declining real income in the US</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2019/03/18/declining-real-income-in-the-us/"/>
   <updated>2019-03-18T13:00:26-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2019/03/18/declining-real-income-in-the-us</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;!-- wp:html --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not a big fan of income inequality &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; as a policy issue. I care more about poverty alleviation and improving the living situation of the majority of Americans, versus capping the income or wealth of a segment of the population. Of course, there is an argument around concentration of power, and of heading off a course where we end up having the modern equivalent of a landed aristocracy, which I’m receptive to. But putting that aside for the moment, when I see graphs that show that income inequality is rising, I find myself thinking “that is a combination of two statistics, only one (the income of the average or lower-income segment of Americans) I really care about”.
&lt;!-- /wp:html --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to do a quick analysis, thinking it would show that income was rising across the board for all segments (even if income was rising faster in some segments vs. others, creating inequality). This is not what I found.
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a sample of &lt;a href=&quot;http://ipums.org&quot;&gt;IPUMS data&lt;/a&gt;, which has individual-level data from the US census. I then built a series of smooth additive quantile regression models using the package &lt;a href=&quot;https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/qgam/qgam.pdf&quot;&gt;qgam&lt;/a&gt;. (A quantile regression is where you’re estimating a conditional percentile, such as the median — 50th percentile — or some other, like 90th or 10th, as opposed to the mean. Smooth and additive = think &lt;a href=&quot;https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/07/30/gam/&quot;&gt;generalized additive model&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then regressed the individual-level income data on the year, age of the respondent, and the sex of the respondent. Here are the graphs of the year coefficient for the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles:
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:image {&quot;id&quot;:661,&quot;width&quot;:697,&quot;height&quot;:504} --&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wp-block-image is-resized&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-3.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-661&quot; width=&quot;697&quot; height=&quot;504&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basically, the largest incomes have kept increasing. The median income has stagnated from sometime between 1990 and 2000. And worst of all, the lower incomes have declined to roughly 1980 levels in the past 20 years.
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, this isn’t the same thing as saying the income of the wealthiest &lt;em&gt;Americans&lt;/em&gt; have kept increasing — people’s incomes change quite a bit from year to year — but it is true to say that if you happen to find yourself in the 10th percentile of incomes in a given year, you’re going to be earning substantially less than you would have been in 2000. That is a Bad Thing.
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-r&quot; data-lang=&quot;r&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# from IPUMS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# includes individual income &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# sex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# age&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;raw_data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data.table&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;~/Downloads/usa_00008.csv&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

   <title>What is socialism?</title>

   <updated>2019-03-04T10:29:03-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2019/03/04/what-is-socialism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;!-- wp:paragraph {&quot;dropCap&quot;:true} --&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;has-drop-cap&quot;&gt;Like many Americans, I have watched with some amazement at the rise of AOC and other forces on the left, often under the guise of &quot;socialism&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But does anyone know what it means?
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Socialism” has come to confuse two different things:
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:list {&quot;ordered&quot;:true} --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A form of economy: State or collective ownership of the &quot;means of production&quot;, meaning government planning and control&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Policy aims: income redistribution, state subsidies to reduce poverty, government provision of healthcare&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:list --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And boy, are these extremely different. Consider, the classic book &lt;em&gt;&lt;a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; aria-label=&quot;The Road to Serfdom (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road_to_Serfdom#The_role_of_government&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;The Road to Serfdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which argued that a planned economy (socialist under definition [1] above) would invariably lead to a loss of freedoms, also contained explicit exceptions for the &lt;em&gt;policy aims&lt;/em&gt; of a welfare state, so long as it was done within the context of a capitalist economy.
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:core-embed/twitter {&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://twitter.com/tvladeck/status/1102226651923005440&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rich&quot;,&quot;providerNameSlug&quot;:&quot;twitter&quot;,&quot;className&quot;:&quot;&quot;} --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Probably because &amp;quot;socialism&amp;quot; has not historically meant things like income redistribution, but rather state/collective control of production. In &amp;quot;The Road to Serfdom&amp;quot; Hayek rails against socialism, but talks about how he doesn&amp;#39;t object to a welfare state &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/xh2hR24u3K&quot;&gt;https://t.co/xh2hR24u3K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; tom vladeck ▽➫ (@tvladeck) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tvladeck/status/1102226651923005440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 3, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:core-embed/twitter --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But is this true? At the time I wrote that tweet, I didn’t have any data to back up my assertion — I had just recently read &lt;em&gt;The Road to Serfdom&lt;/em&gt; so I had a fairly good idea at how socialism was viewed then; and I follow the political discourse so had an intuition about how it’s viewed today. Turns out, according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/243362/meaning-socialism-americans-today.aspx&quot;&gt;Gallup data from 1949 and today&lt;/a&gt;, that my intuition was luckily right.
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:image {&quot;id&quot;:648,&quot;align&quot;:&quot;center&quot;} --&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;wp-block-image&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;aligncenter&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;wp-image-648&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:image --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why does this matter? You might, like me, strenuously object to any movement towards socialism if it meant collective control of the economy while being comfortable with a welfare state. But the muddled definition of socialism out there does not help people draw lines effectively. According to the graph above, most people think of socialism as a set of policy aims; whereas most die-hards view socialism as a different form of economy. That can lead to this kind of confusion:
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;and here is the socialist party defining socialism with the definition people no longer associate with socialism in response to a tweet that nobody truly understands what socialism means...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;😬🤦🏻‍♂️ &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/qBzulp11B1&quot;&gt;https://t.co/qBzulp11B1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; tom vladeck ▽➫ (@tvladeck) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tvladeck/status/1102294506152620033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 3, 2019&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>solving the &#8220;wedding table&#8221; problem in prolog</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2019/01/20/solving-the-wedding-table-problem-in-prolog/"/>
   <updated>2019-01-20T17:54:05-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2019/01/20/solving-the-wedding-table-problem-in-prolog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;what is prolog?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in a logic program you write down facts and rules, and run the program by writing a query.
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a typical fact in prolog looks like this: 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;adult(tom).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which means that &lt;code&gt;tom&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;code&gt;adult&lt;/code&gt;. in many ways this looks like a function, but it’s not; nothing gets returned by this line. 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a rule looks like this: 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;grandparent(X, Y) :-
  parent(X, Z),
  parent(Z, Y).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the &lt;code&gt;:-&lt;/code&gt; part can be read aloud as “is true if”. the whole rule can be read very naturally as “X is Y’s grandparent if X is the parent of Z, and Z is the parent of Y”. (in prolog, variables are written with capital letters). 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and then once you have your facts and rules written down, you run the program by writing a query. say you wrote this:

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;grandparent(X, tom).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the program would try to find some &lt;code&gt;X&lt;/code&gt; that satisfied the conditions of the program that would make everythign true.

&lt;h2&gt;what is the wedding table problem?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;now that we’ve gotten those basics out of the way, let’s dive into the problem we’re going to solve.
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i’ve never had a wedding, but many of my friends have. a common problem, as i understand from second-hand experience, is how to set the seating arrangement. dozens of family and friends from all stages of life, in many cases coming from all over the country (or the world), to sit down at the same moment. it’s a big deal!
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;complicating matters, from any given strata, your guests are probably friends with each other. but, crucially, some of your guests may hold grudges against others. 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;being the good host that you are, you want to sit friends with each other, and keep people with grudges apart. this is all, of course, subject to the constraints to the number of tables and seats that the venue holds. 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;let's work through the solution&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let’s start simple. first we need to know if two people are at the same table. 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;at_this_table(Person1, Person2, ThisTable) :-
    member(Person1, ThisTable),
    member(Person2, ThisTable).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is pretty self-explanatory. the &lt;code&gt;member&lt;/code&gt; tests for set-membership. is &lt;code&gt;Person1&lt;/code&gt; in the set called &lt;code&gt;ThisTable&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but, in general we’re not going to care much if two people are at a &lt;em&gt;particular&lt;/em&gt; table, but rather that they’re both at the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; table, whichever it is.
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to do that, we simply write the following. 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;at_same_table(Person1, Person2, AllTables) :-
    member(ThisTable, AllTables),
    at_this_table(Person1, Person2, ThisTable).

pair_at_same_table(Pair, AllTables) :-
    nth1(1, Pair, Person1),
    nth1(2, Pair, Person2),
    at_same_table(Person1, Person2, AllTables).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;first we now introduced this idea of &lt;code&gt;AllTables&lt;/code&gt;, which is a variable that will be important throughout the rest of the code. the first goal is basically just saying that, first, there is a table among all of the tables avaialable to us, and second, that that table contains both of the people we’re interested in. the second goal simply makes it a bit easier to work with a set containing both of the people in the pair. 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let’s move to the more dramatic issue: making sure that enemies don’t sit at the same table. 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;at_different_tables(Person1, Person2, AllTables) :-
    member(Table1, AllTables),
    member(Table2, AllTables),
    member(Person1, Table1),
    member(Person2, Table2),
    intersection(Table1, Table2, []).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this one was a bit tough to write. first of all, it’d be trivially easy to satisfy this constraint by not sitting one of the people at any of the tables. to guard against that, we first have to make sure that both people are, in fact, sitting at one of the tables in &lt;code&gt;AllTables&lt;/code&gt;. that’s what the first four lines are doing. the last line is just saying that neither of those tables share a common member: that they are different tables. there is probably a cleaner and more direct way of doing this, but it works, so ¯_(ツ)_/¯
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;writing this so we can handle pairs of people we get the following. the first line is just handling the special case where the “pair” is an empty set. 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pair_at_different_tables([], _) :- !.

pair_at_different_tables(Pair, AllTables) :-
    nth1(1, Pair, Person1),
    nth1(2, Pair, Person2),
    at_different_tables(Person1, Person2, AllTables).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, now we have a bit of a problem. it’d be really easy for the program to get around the constraints by making multiple copies of people! say you want david to sit with geoff, and geoff to sit with andrew, but you want to keep david and andrew apart. easy! geoff will sit in two places at once. if you don’t explicitly tell the program that this is not possible, that’s exactly what you’ll get. 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;but, when i tried writing simple solutions to this, i kept running into code that would hang endlessly. some investigations of the debugger told me why. to understand it, you have to understand a bit about what it means to be a “ground” variable in a logic program. 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:heading --&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;grounding&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:heading --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;let’s say you’re solving a sudoku puzzle. in the early stages of solving it, if you were to enumerate all the options in each cell that you hadn’t eliminated yet, you might have something that looks like this:
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;   4      1679   12679  |  139     2369    269   |   8      1239     5
 26789     3    1256789 | 14589   24569   245689 | 12679    1249   124679
  2689   15689   125689 |   7     234569  245689 | 12369   12349   123469
------------------------+------------------------+------------------------
  3789     2     15789  |  3459   34579    4579  | 13579     6     13789
  3679   15679   15679  |  359      8     25679  |   4     12359   12379
 36789     4     56789  |  359      1     25679  | 23579   23589   23789
------------------------+------------------------+------------------------
  289      89     289   |   6      459      3    |  1259     7     12489
   5      6789     3    |   2      479      1    |   69     489     4689
   1      6789     4    |  589     579     5789  | 23569   23589   23689&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most of the cells are not locked in yet. the 4 and 3 in the upper left have been resolved to single values, but everythign else in that 3x3 sector is still open. in this example, the 4 and 3 are “ground” – tied to a specific value, whereas the other cells are unground – they could still inhabit a range of values.
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when the logic program executes, it’s going to create a number of these unground variables that could take on a range of values. so if we were to stop the program mid-way and take a look at one of the tables in our arrangement, it would be a mix of people’s names and variables representing a range of possible people. when we want to make sure that someone is only at one table, we only care about these “ground” variables – those representing actual people. if we don’t do this, the&lt;br /&gt; program doesn’t really know how to execute, and just hangs. 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you’ll notice this &lt;code&gt;\+&lt;/code&gt; in the third goal below. that means “not”. let’s work through these goals in turn.
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ground_member(X, Y) :-
    member(X, Y),
    ground(X).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;simple – this is just finding an X such that X is ground and part of Y
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ground_members_of_table(Table, GroundTable) :-
    findall(X, ground_member(X, Table), GroundTable).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sliiiightly more complicated. this is true if &lt;code&gt;GroundTable&lt;/code&gt; has all of the “named” members of a table at any point in time. we’ll use that below. 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;not_ground_member_of_table(Person, AnotherTable) :-
    ground_members_of_table(AnotherTable, GroundTable),
    \+ member(Person, GroundTable).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as before, this pulls all of the “named” members into &lt;code&gt;GroundTable&lt;/code&gt; and the next line ensures that the person we’re testing is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; part of that set. finally we get to the end:
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;only_at_one_table(Person, AllTables) :-
    member(Table1, AllTables),
    member(Person, Table1),
    subtract(AllTables, [Table1], OtherTables),
    foreach(member(AnotherTable, OtherTables), not_ground_member_of_table(Person, AnotherTable)).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;which very simply does a bit of work to create all the tables the person should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be at (any other table than the one they’re currently at), and then ensures that the person is, in fact, not at any of those other tables. 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we’re so close! now, we just have to make sure that our computer doesn’t do any funny stuff by making some tables magically large or small on us. we need a way to constrain the tables to be as large as we want. so below we have &lt;code&gt;assign_length&lt;/code&gt;, which for reasons that will make sense below, assume that you have a list of tables and a list of lengths that you want to map to them, and this works for one member (at the specified index &lt;code&gt;Idx&lt;/code&gt;). 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;assign_length(Idx, AllTables, Lengths) :-
    nth1(Idx, AllTables, ThisTable),
    nth1(Idx, Lengths, LengthOfThisTable),
    length(ThisTable, LengthOfThisTable).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;okay, so now we can pull all this together. this is the final goal which we can query to find arrangements that will work! going through it line by line, it’s pretty straightfoward. the first three lines ensure that there will only be as many tables as we want, and that they will have only as many seats as we want. the fourth line ensures that pairs that we &lt;em&gt;want to sit together&lt;/em&gt; are at the same table, and that pairs that we &lt;em&gt;want to sit apart&lt;/em&gt; are at different tables. the last two lines ensure that everyone is just sitting at one table.
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;arrangement(Tables, Lengths, Pairs, Exclusions) :-
    length(Tables, Y),
    length(Lengths, Y),
    foreach(between(1, Y, X), assign_length(X, Tables, Lengths)),
    foreach(member(Pair, Pairs), pair_at_same_table(Pair, Tables)),
    foreach(member(Excl, Exclusions), pair_at_different_tables(Excl, Tables)),
    flatten(Pairs, AllPeople),
    foreach(member(Person, AllPeople), only_at_one_table(Person, Tables)).&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;run this code, and what do you get? 
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;?- arrangement([X,Y], [3,3], [[a,b], [c,d]], [[a,c]]).
X = [a, b, a],
Y = [c, d, c]
% variables may be duplicated within the same table if there is space&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;!-- /wp:code --&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:paragraph --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and impossible arrangements will fail:
&lt;!-- /wp:paragraph --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:code --&gt;

&lt;pre class=&quot;wp-block-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;?- arrangment([X,Y], [3,3], [[a,b], [c,d]], [[a,b]]).
false.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

   <title>Microsoft should provide an R environment in Excel (and buy RStudio to help do it)</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/11/08/microsoft-should-provide-an-r-environment-in-excel-and-buy-rstudio-to-help-do-it/"/>
   <updated>2018-11-07T19:48:03-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/11/08/microsoft-should-provide-an-r-environment-in-excel-and-buy-rstudio-to-help-do-it</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Excel doesn’t seem to be going anywhere, and nor should it — it’s a great tool, and the best one for countless use cases. At the same time, analyses that would previously live in Excel are now being done in R and Python, and many more analyses that would previously not have not been done at all are now being done in R and Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Everything I’m about to write applies to both R and Python equally, but I know the R space a lot better.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the consumers of these analyses are often not code-literate. But they want to feel ownership of the analysis, be able to play with assumptions, etc. They don’t just want the results handed to them. This is a core benefit of Excel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, while un- or semi-structured data (e.g. natural text, JSON files) and media (images, audio, video) are becoming more common as the subject of analyses, tabular data is, and will be, the most common data format for the foreseeable future. Excel handles these formats natively and transparently as worksheets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t tell you how many times I would have loved to have done the following for a client:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Store the raw data as (a) worksheet(s)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Have a key assumptions sheet that lists the key inputs for an analysis, which the user can change&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Have R scripts that read from the assumptions and the raw data, and produce outputs (charts, statistics, tables, etc) right into Excel&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Have a button that, when pressed, sources a script (that can of course call into other scripts)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obvious bonus points would be if you could fire up an R editor right within Excel that could refer to worksheets and cells inside of its environment as just another tab inside of Excel. In short, why can’t Excel look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot-2018-11-07-19.20.30.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-630&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screenshot-2018-11-07-19.20.30.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2018-11-07 19.20.30&quot; width=&quot;964&quot; height=&quot;734&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, it would be great if the text files could be used with version control like Git.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, this would not be straightforward to do, but Microsoft could make it happen and build Excel for the next generation. It would also open up a zillion new use cases and deliverable formats for internal or external consulting firms (like mine).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I make the additional assertion that Microsoft should buy RStudio? Because &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;R is growing like crazy&lt;/a&gt;, and RStudio and Jupyter are becoming the default environments for doing analysis in R. But Jupyter is an open source organization, so not something Microsoft can buy, while RStudio is a company focused on supporting its development products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft wanted to catch up to the curve in terms of where the best teams do their analysis (no longer Excel), it should find a way to own the R space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it is trying to do that — it has &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2018/02/what-does-microsoft-do-with-r.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an entire R ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;. But even as someone that works day-in, day-out in R, and follows everything going on in R, I have no idea how it works. It feels to me that it’s aimed at IT managers in enterprises and not the individual data scientists that are doing the most to drive adoption within those companies. It’s not the right approach — as they know, because they bought Github, whose primary adoption vector was through individual (or small team) adoption within larger enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were in corporate development and/or product strategy at Microsoft, this would be a no-brainer to me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>&#8220;Should&#8221;</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/11/01/should/"/>
   <updated>2018-11-01T10:00:20-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/11/01/should</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think “should” — especially when found in its past tense construction “should have” — is one of the most dangerous words to utter and thoughts to allow yourself to think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Should” can’t exist on its own. There is no objective “should”. When something “should” be some way or another, that’s only true in relation to a particular standard, that’s not typically referenced or even acknowledged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why “should” is dangerous is that it’s easy to forget (or most people don’t know) that this standard needs to come along with it, and the “should” feels just objectively true. When one says “this should be easier”, “I shouldn’t have to work this hard”, etc, etc, it’s easy to feel like that “should” is just objectively true. But it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Make the Senate matter less</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/10/07/make-the-senate-matter-less/"/>
   <updated>2018-10-07T19:54:46-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/10/07/make-the-senate-matter-less</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On Politics Twitter there has been a lot of chatter about how undemocratic the Senate is as an institution — e.g. that a person in Wyoming has 68x more influence on the Senate via their vote as someone in California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Senate is not going to change any time soon. Even if other things may even out the partisan imbalance like DC or Puerto Rican statehood:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Currently, the *average* Senate seat is about 6 points more Republican than the country overall (because smaller-population states happen to be more Republican right now). Adding DC and PR as states would reduce that advantage to about 2 points instead. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/kkP6zSFK50&quot;&gt;https://t.co/kkP6zSFK50&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1048984649597427712?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 7, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;And there is at least one straightforward way to make the presidential election by popular vote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is another way to address this issue: make the Senate matter less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/2018/10/05/trump-federalism/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I continue to see the intractability of agreement at the federal level something that could be more providentially solved by moving more domestic policy to the state level.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not an argument for less government, or more government, just a shift in the locus of government from the federal level to the state level. Theoretically, this should not be a partisan issue: let liberals in California and New York have the government they want and conservatives in Utah and Kansas have their style of government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Trump &#038; Federalism</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/10/05/trump-federalism/"/>
   <updated>2018-10-04T22:28:07-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/10/05/trump-federalism</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I don’t think I’m the only person who grew up distrustful of the generically Republican position that we should weaken the federal government and “send more power back to the States” who is now re-evaluating the power of the federal government, now that it is in the hands of the spray tan menace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think for a lot of us, this position seemed a bit too close to a modern articulation of “states rights”. It was definitely true in the past — and is probably true today — that it is impossible to evaluate Republican policy positions separately from the party’s antagonism toward civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, assuming it is possible to do that, I’m finding the idea of moving more and more policy decisions out of the federal government and into respective state governments more and more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the country does not agree on health care policy. The citizens of New York, Massachusetts, and California probably agree. And those of Utah and Idaho probably agree. (In all cases, I mean agree to the degree required to reach a consensus in government). But New York and Utah definitely don’t. But should they have to?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most states are as large as national governments elsewhere in the world. Even Utah, which is 31st in US State GDP, has an economy almost as large as New Zealand’s and a population over 3 million people. By comparison, Denmark and Norway, two Scandinavian countries often cited as the gold standard for quality of government, have populations of 5.7 million and 5.2 million, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So each state definitely has the &lt;em&gt;resources&lt;/em&gt; to run their own health care system. Why not let Utah run their system and let New York run their system? I don’t know why this is not possible, but I also don’t think it makes much sense to continue trying to get the whole country to adopt a single system when some coalitions in some states want one thing and other coalitions in other states want something else. And why wouldn’t this be the best possible way to resolve the disagreement? If one approach succeeds and the other fails, won’t there be a lot of pressure on the unsuccessful states to adopt the more successful approach?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This logic definitely doesn’t apply everywhere — some things really do have to be handled at a national level. Climate policy, for example; or the military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many domestic policies that are intractable at the national level are much more tractable at the state level (or lower). I’m beginning to believe we should stop trying to agree on policies and accept our disagreement.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Whatever else ____ is, ____ is also a thought.</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/10/02/whatever-else-____-is-____-is-also-a-thought/"/>
   <updated>2018-10-02T12:31:41-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/10/02/whatever-else-____-is-____-is-also-a-thought</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years I’ve experienced with meditation. I’ve always been an “in my own head” guy and — like many millennials — I’ve turned to meditation in an attempt to wrangle more control over the thoughts and feelings spinning in my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got much more to say about my experience with meditation, but for now I’ll share one transformative (and perhaps banal) personal insight I had the other day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be a &lt;a href=&quot;http://headspace.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Headspace&lt;/a&gt; guy, but recently I’ve been trying &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.10percenthappier.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;10% Happier&lt;/a&gt; and am really loving the variety of approaches and teachers. One meditation I’ve done a few times is called “The Reset” and is designed for times when you’re feeling overwhelmed and totally crazy busy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The line the teacher used is: “whatever else ‘busy-ness’ is, it’s also a thought”. And it is! Busy-ness is &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; in the sense that you may have way more things to do then can reasonably be done; you may be running late; etc. But it’s also the experience of feeling “I’m so busy” “I have so much to do” “I’m so overwhelmed” etc. And those are thoughts. They are prompted by the real-life experience you’re having, but they are also independent of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meditation teaches you to identify, label, and ultimately dismiss thoughts on command. So why not do so with busy-ness? It can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s nothing special about the experience of “busy-ness”. Whatever else &lt;strong&gt;__ is, __&lt;/strong&gt; is a thought. You can learn to say, “oh, that’s me being angry”, or “oh, that’s me being nervous” or “oh, that’s me feeling slighted”, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So am I trying to say that I’ve reached this level of enlightenment and that I can choose not to feel busy, get angry, or feel anxious? No — not at all. Or at least not in all situations all the time. But, sometimes, I can. Maybe about 10% of the time. And that’s a pretty good improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Routines</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/10/01/routines/"/>
   <updated>2018-10-01T09:33:55-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/10/01/routines</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I have read many times that successful people often have very stringent routines. The book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307273601/dailrout-20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Daily Routines&lt;/a&gt; is literally just a list of different habits of famous artists and creatives. You can go to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dailyroutines.typepad.com/daily_routines/artists/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;accompanying blog&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important constant is that there is a routine at all; even if there aren’t many similarities across routines (some work in the morning, some in the evening, and so on).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always struggled to create a routine for myself. For instance, I exercise about 70% of days. But the &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; I exercise is hardly the same from day to day. Breakfast? Who knows? Lunch? Could be anywhere from 11am to 4pm. And so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This writing — every day when I have my coffee, I write a short blog post — is an(other) attempt at creating a rhythm for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For for the most part where I’ve landed is the idea of a daily checklist; I have a few things that I want to do &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; day, and I hit the x on each one as I do them. And as I go about my day, I’m thinking about getting those things done. I use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.stridesapp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Strides&lt;/a&gt; to do that (which is, for instance, how I know I work out about 70% of days).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The checklist helps keep me on track, but I still want to get that rhythm down.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Apologies</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/09/28/apologies/"/>
   <updated>2018-09-28T12:01:11-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/09/28/apologies</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On the same day this article came out about Linus Torvalds, the founder and BDFL of Linux&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-28-11.47.11.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-612&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-28-11.47.11.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2018-09-28 11.47.11&quot; width=&quot;665&quot; height=&quot;101&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the occasion to apologize to someone I work with. The parallels between Linus’s story on my own struck me (although everything about his story is much larger compared to mine): we both lead technical, remote teams that principally communicate in writing. And we both can have the tendency to forget how much of an impact our words can have when we fire them into the ether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, I had been an asshole, and it was time for me to apologize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll never understand why people don’t apologize, and apologize directly. I think it’s one of the most underutilized skills and behaviors in the world. Everyone is human; everyone makes mistakes; everyone hurts other people, intentionally or unintentionally. If you don’t take responsibility for it, those transgressions accumulate and eventually people (even the people you’re closest with) will no longer want to have anything to do with you. If you do, then not only do you reset the relationship, but you can actually build a stronger one by signaling that you’re willing to accept some humble pie for the sake of the relationship — that it matters that much to you. There’s a very big in results between the two behaviors and it just doesn’t compute to me why people don’t see that and can’t bring themselves to say they’re sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sorrywatch.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sorry Watch&lt;/a&gt; is a pretty funny blog that analyzes public apologies (e.g. by celebrities and corporations) and savages wishy-washy non-apologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Insomnia</title>

   <updated>2018-09-27T09:01:35-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/09/27/insomnia</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve struggled with on-and-off insomnia my whole life. Sometimes I can’t fall asleep. Sometimes I can’t stay asleep. For months at a time, I will sleep normally, and hope that the issue is behind me. Then, out of nowhere, or sometimes out of somewhere, insomnia will come roaring back. For a week, or sometimes weeks at a time, I will barely sleep. The thought of “it’s bedtime, time to get into bed” fills me with anxiety because I know that tonight ain’t it. Only when I finally build up a ton of sleep pressure do I know that things will sort themselves out. I just got out of a major insomnia streak, but last night things reverted. Here’s hoping they revert back quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Textbooks</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/09/26/textbooks/"/>
   <updated>2018-09-26T09:12:25-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/09/26/textbooks</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Textbooks are great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I have some training in statistics and machine learning, for the most part I’m completely self-taught. A big part of that teaching has been to buy a great textbook on a given subject and to follow along until I really understood the subject. Coursera, YouTube, Stack Overflow, tutorials on the internet, etc are great, but textbooks are excellent too, and I think they are underutilized. Especially since there is a mental categorization of “that’s for when you’re in school” that people fall into.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was at business school that I started doing some serious data science that my addiction to buying textbooks started. Right now I’m working through &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Analysis-Experiments-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1439868131&quot;&gt;Design and Analysis of Experiments with R&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/em&gt;since Gradient is doing more (and more complex) survey-based experiments (I think at this very moment we are running four discrete choice experiments for clients)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-26-08.57.41.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-604 size-medium&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Screenshot-2018-09-26-08.57.41-300x300.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2018-09-26 08.57.41&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest, this one is a bit of a slog. But getting experimental design right is crucial for successful projects so I’m working through it; I’ve had a few a ha moments already — like why they’re called “orthogonal” designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of the textbooks I use are written to work with R, although not all. Some of the textbooks that go into my hall of fame are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Applied-Predictive-Modeling-Max-Kuhn/dp/1461468485/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1537967440&amp;amp;sr=1-3&amp;amp;keywords=applied+predictive+modeling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Applied Predictive Modeling&lt;/a&gt; (survey of lots of statistical and machine learning methods)&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>How we think about hiring</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/09/25/how-we-think-about-hiring/"/>
   <updated>2018-09-25T08:51:50-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/09/25/how-we-think-about-hiring</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gradientmetrics.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gradient&lt;/a&gt; is growing, and we need to hire. We are kicking off our process this week. It’s funny, along with sales, how to hire well is one of those crucial, practical things they don’t teach you in business school. We have been sort of flying by the seat of our pants each time when we run this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our typical fashion, we decided we would try thinking things through and doing them a bit differently. For our last process, we decided very early on that we would not think about defining a “role” and finding someone that could be slot into that. I basically don’t believe in defined roles for knowledge-work. The whole idea is that it’s something that requires creative thought, so how can you predict in advance what will be needed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, even if defined roles make sense elsewhere, work at Gradient is far too fluid for it to work with us. We all need to pitch in on all areas of the business: building statistical models, hooking up our CRM system to our email system, evaluating different AWS servers, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the way we did it last time was to define a whole bunch of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Experiences (projects or models they had built in the past that were synonymous with what we do)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Skills (things they know how to do, from statistical modeling to server management and so on)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Traits (most importantly: do they want to work remotely?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And give each of them a weight. People that had a bunch of highly-weighted attributes were more attractive to us than people that did not, simple as that. We even automated a large part of this process, having interested candidates take a survey that gave us a score. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gradientmetrics.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_dhucNIKHSHRAtXn&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Take it here&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re interested — although consider this one obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think that for the next hire, we’ll follow a similar process. It maps well to my mental model of how our company works and worked very well for us last time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Thinking in Prolog</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/09/24/thinking-in-prolog/"/>
   <updated>2018-09-24T08:50:23-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/09/24/thinking-in-prolog</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been having a lot of fun working on a side project written in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;Prolog&lt;/a&gt;, which is a &lt;em&gt;logical&lt;/em&gt; programming language. It has been incredibly difficult to wrap my mind around how it works but I’m getting there, and I can see that “there” is a pretty powerful place. It makes me wonder why this paradigm isn’t used for more applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out (you may already know this if you write code) that programming languages work &lt;em&gt;very differently&lt;/em&gt; depending on which &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;paradigm&lt;/a&gt; they use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Common programming paradigms include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;imperative&lt;/strong&gt; in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;procedural&lt;/strong&gt; which groups instructions into procedures,&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;object-oriented&lt;/strong&gt; which groups instructions together with the part of the state they operate on,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;declarative&lt;/strong&gt; in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;functional&lt;/strong&gt; in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;logic&lt;/strong&gt; in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mathematical&lt;/strong&gt; in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve found functional programming to be so intuitive and object-oriented (probably the most common paradigm today) to be so counterintuitive that I almost always write my programs in a functional style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a logic program, you write down a set of facts and rules. That’s it. That’s your program. And then you run the program by asking it if it can find a solution to a new query.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prolog in particular is built around a type of logical statement called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Horn clause&lt;/a&gt; that basically reads “X is true if Y and Z are true”. In Prolog that would look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;X :- Y, Z.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more complete program (but still tiny) program would look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;food(sandwich). % declaring a fact that sandwich is a food
drink(water). % declaring that water is a drink

meal(X, Y) :- food(X), drink(Y).
% X and Y (variables) make a meal if X is a food &amp;amp; Y is a drink&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you run this program, you’ll get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;?- meal(X, Y).
X = sandwich,
Y = water.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a toy example, but you can see how quickly the complexity could build up with ever-more relationships and so on. I’m working on writing a program to solve the common wedding-seating problem where you have a set number of tables, people you want to sit next to each other, and people that you want to sit at different tables. It’s fun.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The space of things you can write</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/09/23/the-space-of-things-you-can-write/"/>
   <updated>2018-09-23T11:14:04-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/09/23/the-space-of-things-you-can-write</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This morning I was reminded of a few tweets by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fchollet&quot;&gt;Francois Chollet&lt;/a&gt;, a machine-learning researcher and practitioner who is the lead on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keras&quot;&gt;Keras&lt;/a&gt;, the most popular deep learning library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The scope of thoughts you can write is much broader than the scope of thoughts you can think on your own. Written language, much like computer code, can express programs that are out of reach for brains alone. Write to think.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; François Chollet (@fchollet) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/988276122541547521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 23, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;In particular live thoughts have limited recursion depth, and only have access to limited working memory; written thoughts have unlimited recursion depth, and paper has unlimited memory.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; François Chollet (@fchollet) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/988276351927898112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;April 23, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These thoughts have stuck with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning, I read Fred Wilson’s post celebrating &lt;a href=&quot;https://avc.com/2018/09/fifteen-years/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fifteen years’ of writing on his blog&lt;/a&gt;, AVC.Reading it, I wondered the degree to which Fred has benefited from the discipline of expressing his thoughts in a precise, unlimited, and permanent form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been missing that. Twitter has replaced writing for me — I agree with Brian Norgard’s take that Twitter’s change to 280 characters was the final death blow to blogging (if Google killing Reader was the pummel of body blows that knocked it down)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;It’s astonishing how small yet surgical tweaks to scale products can have such profound impact&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threads &amp;amp; 280 characters on Twitter effectively killed what was left of the blogging eco-system&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who would have thought minuscule improvements would go so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That’s effective product&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Norgard (@BrianNorgard) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/BrianNorgard/status/1036653610874990592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;September 3, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if writing is self-directed, Twitter is a to-do list of things to think about or react to created by other people (if, done well, created by a very select group of other people that you’ve chosen and refined over time).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting it all together, I miss writing and spend too much time on Twitter. So it’s time to restart this thing. Should be fun.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Remembrance</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/07/01/remembrance/"/>
   <updated>2018-07-01T15:12:22-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/07/01/remembrance</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;He and I had been close when we were young. I remember him as a toddler; I even think I remember holding him as a baby. Four years my junior, we would play together as little children at my house along with some of my friends. I remember playing “buffalo”, where we would essentially run at each other on all fours. He would make up for his disadvantage in size and years with a fierce tenacity. But you would have been misled if that’s what you took of him, because he would grow into the sweetest, most kind-hearted person you could find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, school and summers filled with extracurricular vocations filled the spaces where we would have seen each other, and we drifted apart. It wouldn’t be honest to say that he was a major fixture in my life over many years, but that did not stop me from feeling the tensile strength of the residual bond between us, reaching forward from back in time, when it snapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=life+is+a+braid+in+spacetime&amp;amp;oq=life+is+a+braid+in+&amp;amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0.6168j1j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8&quot;&gt;life is a braid through time&lt;/a&gt;, our lives had once been entwined, and I found myself grasping too late for threads that had long ago become unfurled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pictures at the funeral showed him rock climbing — why didn’t we ever go together? That was something we both loved. Why didn’t I at least ring him from time to time to keep up on his story?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mom asked me to reach out to him after he completed his last semester. He had been in and out of graduate school, dealing with depression, and he had gone back and done well. Wouldn’t I just send him a quick note of congratulations? Of course I would. And within a few days, he wrote back, but I never opened his message. While he was alive, I never read him tell me he had had some ups and downs, but that he would persevere. And by the way, congratulations to me on becoming an uncle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How could I, who had lived with someone whose affliction with Bipolar II manifested itself, who, after that chapter, committed to being vigilant to these warning signs, who had believed that familiarity with mental health symptoms should be something they teach you in school so as to become common knowledge, let this pass without pouncing on it? Demand a phone call; take a flight to Chicago; whatever it took. At least read the message he sent back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe it’s just a fact of life that these pathways sometimes only reveal themselves in the counterfactual. That only when it’s impossible to make them, do some decisions make themselves apparent. My grandmother used to say that the three worst words in the English language are “coulda, woulda, shoulda”, but our imaginations can torment us with alternate histories. And maybe it was fate, but when reading a book on this very topic, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/business/dealbook/review-the-book-of-why-examines-the-science-of-cause-and-effect.html&quot;&gt;The Book of Why&lt;/a&gt;, I came across the following quote (with genders reversed):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am convinced that, whether right or not, he was sure some sinister change was going on in his brain, from which he could never recover. So in tenderest love to us all he chose to spare us the grief of sharing with him the spectacle of such a tragic decline.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can only hope that it was done with tender love, and not only some excruciating psychic pain. And I’m not sure whether to hope that I could have made a difference, or could not have. Either way, it’s a moot point now, and a voice nags at me that this gratuitous self-examination wildly misses the point. A good person is dead, he had been in pain, and his family is now exploring the depths of grief.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>So. Many. Fucking. Bots. (And they&#8217;re good)</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/03/26/so-many-fucking-bots-and-theyre-good/"/>
   <updated>2018-03-26T17:45:37-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/03/26/so-many-fucking-bots-and-theyre-good</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ugh. This can be considered a follow-up &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/2018/03/26/our-discourse-is-still-being-poisoned/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;to my post yesterday on the same issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Facebook today, I saw the following link in my “trending” section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-2018-03-26-16.25.54.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-570&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-2018-03-26-16.25.54.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2018-03-26 16.25.54&quot; width=&quot;322&quot; height=&quot;229&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is essentially just this one picture that’s been circulating around Twitter:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/LazyyMillennial/status/977267940796936192&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, isn’t this some great liberal content! Red meat for the base. Well — knowing what I know about deception on Twitter, my first instinct these days is to be skeptical about the integrity of the information I’m getting. And, sure enough, if you go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/LazyyMillennial&quot;&gt;@LazyyMillennial&lt;/a&gt;’s twitter timeline, it’s been made very recently and devoid of any real personal content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very much not surprisingly, if you run this account through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mkearney/botrnot&quot;&gt;same botrnot model I used yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, you get a very high likelihood (~92%) that this account is a bot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-2018-03-26-17.30.33.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-571&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-2018-03-26-17.30.33.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2018-03-26 17.30.33&quot; width=&quot;229&quot; height=&quot;136&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Hill” is a pretty well-known outlet, and as of the time I checked out the page 2,937 shares. And, of course, they are not the only ones that picked up on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/woman-sneaks-anti-ted-cruz-message-during-photo-op-with-ted-cruz_us_5ab7ea95e4b008c9e5f88c7a&quot;&gt;HuffPo is carrying the story&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Texas-woman-trolls-Ted-Cruz-photo-Beto-Orourke-12781402.php&quot;&gt;Houston Chronicle&lt;/a&gt;. All of these outlets are credulously referring to this Twitter account as “Rebecca” even though they have not gotten any kind of quote from her (they only quote what’s posted on her profile). Some are even featuring a screenshot of her photo in a kind of Ken Burns moving image with narration video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, perhaps the picture is real (Huffpo’s story had the image tweeted out by someone else), but “Rebecca” is certainly helping to amplify the message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-2018-03-26-17.32.13-1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-573&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-2018-03-26-17.32.13-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2018-03-26 17.32.13&quot; width=&quot;516&quot; height=&quot;211&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this a bot in the sense of a purely automated account? I don’t think so. It seems to me like a human writing these quotes. But is this person the person they claim to be? Seems very, very unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you start looking for bots — or impersonated accounts, which may be a better term, they are everywhere. That last piece of content you chuckled at while wondering why {conservatives, liberals} were so dumb? (“Yeaaahh we gottem good!”) Or that made you really angry, and made you wonder how “the other side” could think that way? That may well have been manufactured. That may not be real. There seem to be a lot of “Rebeccas” out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Our discourse is still being poisoned</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/03/26/our-discourse-is-still-being-poisoned/"/>
   <updated>2018-03-25T20:59:41-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2018/03/26/our-discourse-is-still-being-poisoned</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Today on Twitter I came across a tweet that seemed so heartless, so inhumane, that I had to wonder whether or not the perpetrator, was, in fact… human&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Unbelievable. I have no words. &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/BPuEbtlrc0&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/BPuEbtlrc0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Patrick Petty (@PatrickPetty23) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PatrickPetty23/status/977656503992758272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;March 24, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who don’t know, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Patrickpetty23&quot;&gt;Patrick Petty&lt;/a&gt; is a father of one of the Parkland victims. Unlike most of the people that have emerged and become quite visible out of Parkland, Patrick is conservative and pro Second Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the tweet above is beyond inappropriate. But if you look further, something seems a bit off. If you check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SimonSaysBooHoo&quot;&gt;@simonsaysboohoo&lt;/a&gt;’s profile, it’s a mélange of emotionally-charged liberal content. It’s… &lt;strong&gt;exclusively&lt;/strong&gt; a mélange of emotionally-charged liberal content. There’s nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mkearney/botrnot&quot;&gt;botrnot&lt;/a&gt; model developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kearneymw&quot;&gt;Mike Kearney&lt;/a&gt;, this account has a very high probability of being a bot (~92%):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-2018-03-25-20.23.34.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-565&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screenshot-2018-03-25-20.23.34.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2018-03-25 20.23.34&quot; width=&quot;264&quot; height=&quot;114&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big problem of course is that a lot of people are going to think that @simonsaysboohoo is a real person, reflective of an “other side” where people actually do think these objectionable and immoral things. And why would they think otherwise? A person is not privy to the summary statistics of user behavior that the model above is using to calculate the probability of bot-hood. We are enormously easy to fool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;someone&lt;/strong&gt; is trying to inject poison into our public debate; but who? and why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And probably most importantly, why isn’t Twitter (and the same applies to Facebook and Google) doing more to prevent this kind of deception?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Gradient&#8217;s Principles</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2017/09/02/gradients-principles/"/>
   <updated>2017-09-01T21:06:57-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2017/09/02/gradients-principles</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I started &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gradientmetrics.com&quot;&gt;Gradient&lt;/a&gt; I knew that eventually, I wanted it to be a principle-driven company. What does that mean, and why is it important? Well — here’s what I wrote our team (on July 29th):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guys: one more thing. One thing that I have started to think about, and would like both of you to think about, is what &lt;code&gt;principles&lt;/code&gt; should we develop to drive our company. I would like Gradient to be a principle-driven company. Why not a customer-driven, or technology-driven, or profit-driven company? Well of course we should always serve our customers, use the latest technologies, and make money. But customers change (and can sometimes turn on you), and technology and profit are &lt;code&gt;means&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;ends&lt;/code&gt;. Principles don’t change - they won’t reneg on a contract, they won’t turn on you, etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Having a core set of principles will help guide our behavior, especially in difficult circumstances. What happens when a customer doesn’t like our analysis? What happens when a customer renegs on a contract? How should we behave?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When we hire new people, what should we be looking for, other than technical competency? When we have a difficult decision, what should we be considering, other than our respective opinions?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This may seem fluffy, but at the best companies it’s anything but. Specifically, I’m thinking about Amazon, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.jobs/principles&quot;&gt;whose twelve leadership principles&lt;/a&gt; are used &lt;code&gt;all the time&lt;/code&gt; in the regular course of business there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So I’d like everyone to start thinking about what they’d like to see in our set of principles, and when it’s right, get them down on paper. There’s no timeline to this (yet), as this is not a case where done is better than perfect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the end of the day, they have to do at least these four things:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;reflect our personal values&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;be effective guides to decision making and action&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;serve as an effective rubric for character inside our company&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;be &lt;code&gt;useful&lt;/code&gt; - they can't just live on a shelf somewhere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to say that just over a month later — after a collective process where the three of us came together, pooled our thoughts, and worked collectively to draft the same document — we’ve landed on the following eleven principles. I’m immensely proud of them, and can’t wait to use them all the time in day-to-day discussions. While some of them are especially important given our remote set-up, they all feel mostly timeless to me. Have a read and let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gradient leaders… (and we’re all leaders)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are honest and integral to a fault:&lt;/strong&gt; if we say something will be done, then it will be done. We conform our words to reality (honesty) and reality to our words (integrity).&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do more with less:&lt;/strong&gt; We are frugal and look for ways to avoid spending time and money when it is not needed.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Think win-win:&lt;/strong&gt; Success is not zero-sum. Our clients, partners, and vendors' success is our success. We build credible, reliable, and honest relationships with every client, partner, and ally.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prove themselves wrong:&lt;/strong&gt; We seek diverse perspectives, look for alternative hypotheses, investigate the details, and stress-test our analyses to ensure that we are right. We never assume we are right.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are obsessed with constant improvement:&lt;/strong&gt; Individually, we are always looking to learn new techniques and develop valuable skills sets. We proactively seek feedback to improve our collective performance.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaborate and communicate extremely well:&lt;/strong&gt; We value team contribution over individual contribution. We are excellent team players that go the extra mile to make it easy to work with others.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliver results, not work:&lt;/strong&gt; We don't value work, we value results. We are always moving toward delivering value to our clients.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take care of each other:&lt;/strong&gt; We care for each other’s well-being and celebrate alternative perspectives.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-Manage:&lt;/strong&gt; We take ownership of our work by prioritizing and organizing effectively with our colleagues while acting on behalf of the entire company.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investigate deeply:&lt;/strong&gt; We are never satisfied with the first layer of understanding, or fixing symptoms instead of underlying causes. We fix problems so they stay fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are ambitious risk takers:&lt;/strong&gt; We push the definition of normal by moving fast and pursuing new, unconventional solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Unpacking the election results using bayesian inference</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2016/12/31/unpacking-the-election-results-using-bayesian-inference/"/>
   <updated>2016-12-30T20:48:40-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2016/12/31/unpacking-the-election-results-using-bayesian-inference</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As anyone whose read this blog recently can surmise, I’m pretty interested in how this election turned out, and have been doing &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/2016/12/18/a-different-kind-of-political-geography/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;some exploratory research&lt;/a&gt; into the makeup of our electorate. Over the past few weeks I’ve taken the analysis a step further and built a sophisticated regression that goes as far as anything I’ve seen to unpack what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background on probability distributions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Skip this section if you’re familiar with the beta and binomial distributions.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get started explaining how the model works, we need to discuss some important probability distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is easy: the coin flip. In math, we call a coin flip a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bernoulli trial&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re the same thing. A flip of a fair coin is what a mathematician would call a “Bernoulli trial with p = 0.5”. The “p = 0.5” part simply means that the coin has a 50% chance of landing heads (and 50% chance of landing tails). But in principle you can weight coins however you want, and you can have Bernoulli trials with p = 0.1, p = 0.75, p = 0.9999999, or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s imagine we flip one of these coins 100 times. What is the probability that it comes up heads 50 times? Even if the coin is fair (p = 0.5), just by random chance it may come up heads only 40 times, or may come up heads more than you’d expect - like 60 times. It is even &lt;strong&gt;possible&lt;/strong&gt; for it to come up 100 times in a row, although the odds of that are vanishingly small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distribution of possible times the coin comes up heads is called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;binomial distribution&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;probability distribution&lt;/span&gt; is a set of numbers that assigns a value to every &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;possible&lt;/span&gt; outcome. In the case of 100 coin flips, the binomial distribution will assign a value to every number between 0 and 100 (which are all the possible numbers of times the coin could come up heads), and all of these values will sum to 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s go one step further. Let’s imagine you have a big bag of different coins, all with different weights. Let’s imagine we grab a bunch of coins out of the bag and then flip them. How can we model the distribution of the number of times those coins will come up heads?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to think about the distribution of possible weights the coins have. Let’s imagine we line up the coins from the lowest weight to the highest weight, and stack coins with the same weight on top of each other. The relative “heights” of each stack tell us how likely it is that we grab a coin with that weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we basically have something called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;beta distribution&lt;/a&gt;, which is a family of distributions that tell us how likely it is we’ll get a number between 0 and 1. Beta distributions are very flexible, and they can look like any of these shapes and almost everything in between:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[caption id=”attachment_466” align=”alignnone” width=”960”]&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot-2016-12-30-16.31.15.png&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;http://www.brucehardie.com/talks/cba_tut_art_16_HO.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;wp-image-466 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Screenshot-2016-12-30-16.31.15.png&quot; width=&quot;960&quot; height=&quot;637&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Taken from Bruce Hardie: http://www.brucehardie.com/talks/cba_tut_art_16_HO.pdf[/caption]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you had a bag like the upper left, most of the coins would be weighted to come up tails, and if you had a bag like the lower right, most of the coins would be weighted to come up heads; if you had a bag like the lower left, the coins would either be weighted very strongly to come up tails or very strongly to come up heads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This distribution is called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-binomial_distribution&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;beta-binomial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model set up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might now be seeing where this is going. While we can’t observe individuals’ voting behavior (other than whether or not they voted), we can look at the talleys at local levels, like counties. And let’s say, some time before the election, you lined up every voter in a county and stacked them the same way you did with coins as before, but instead of the probability of “coming up heads”, you’d be looking at a voter’s probability of voting for one of the two major candidates. That would look like a beta distribution. You could then model the number of votes for a particular candidate in a particular county would as a beta-binomial distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in our model we can say the number of votes &lt;code&gt;V[i]&lt;/code&gt; in county &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is distributed beta-binomial with &lt;code&gt;N[i]&lt;/code&gt; voters and voters with &lt;code&gt;p[i]&lt;/code&gt; propensity to vote for that candidate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;V[i] ~ binomial(p[i], N[i])
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But we’re keeping in mind that &lt;code&gt;p[i]&lt;/code&gt; is not a single number but a beta distribution with parameters &lt;code&gt;alpha[i]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;beta[i]&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;p[i] ~ beta(alpha[i], beta[i])
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we need to talk about &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt;. A beta distribution needs two parameters to tell you what kind of shape it has. Commonly, these are called &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt; (I know, it’s confusing to have the name of the distribution and one of its parameters be the same), and the way you can think about it is that &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; “pushes” the distribution to the right (i.e. in the lower right above) and that &lt;code&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt; “pushes” the distribution to the left (i.e. in the upper left above). Both &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt; have to be greater than zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, while this helps us understand what’s going on with the shape of the distribution, it’s not a useful way to encapsulate the information if we were to talk about voting behavior. If something (say unemployment) were to “push” the distribution one way (say having an effect on &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt;), it would also likely have an effect on &lt;code&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt; (because they push in opposite directions). Ideally, we’d separate alpha and beta into two unrelated pieces of information. Let’s see how we can do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a property of the beta distribution that its average is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; 
   alpha
------------
alpha + beta
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let’s just define a new term called &lt;code&gt;mu&lt;/code&gt; that’s equal to this average.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;        alpha
mu = ------------
     alpha + beta
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then we can define a new term &lt;code&gt;phi&lt;/code&gt; like so&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;       alpha
phi = --------
        mu  
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a few lines of arithmetic, we can solve for everything else:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt; 
phi = alpha + beta
alpha = mu * phi 
beta = (1 - mu) * phi
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; is the amount of “pushing” to the right and &lt;code&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt; is the amount of “pushing” to the left in the distribution, then &lt;code&gt;phi&lt;/code&gt; is all of the pushing (either left or right) in the distribution. This is a sort of “uniformity” parameter. Large values of &lt;code&gt;phi&lt;/code&gt; mean that almost all of the distribution is near the average (think the upper right beta distribution above) - the &lt;code&gt;alpha&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;beta&lt;/code&gt; are pushing up against each other - and small values of &lt;code&gt;phi&lt;/code&gt; mean that almost all the values are away from the average (think the beta distribution on the lower left above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this parameterization, we can model propensity and polarization independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now we can use county-level information to set up regressions on &lt;code&gt;mu&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;phi&lt;/code&gt; - and therefore on the county’s distribution of voters, and how they ended up voting. Since &lt;code&gt;mu&lt;/code&gt; has to be between 0 and 1 we use the &lt;code&gt;logit&lt;/code&gt; link function, and since &lt;code&gt;phi&lt;/code&gt; has to be greater than zero, we use the &lt;code&gt;exponential&lt;/code&gt; link function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;logit(mu[i]) = linear function of predictors in county i
log(phi[i]) = linear function of predictors in county i
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “linear functions of predictors” have the format:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;coef[uninsured] * uninsured[i] + coef[unemployment] * unemployment[i] + ...
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;uninsured[i]&lt;/code&gt; is the uninsurance rate in that county and &lt;code&gt;coef[uninsured]&lt;/code&gt; is the effect that uninsurance has on the average propensity of voters in that county (in the first equation) or the polarity/centrality of the voting distribution (in the second equation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each county, I extracted nine pieces of information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The proportion of residents that do not have insurance&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The rate of unemployment&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The rate of diabetes (a proxy for overall health levels)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The median income&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The violent crime rate&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The median age&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The gini coefficient (an index of income heterogeneity)&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The rate of high-school graduation&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The proportion of residents that are white&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since each of the above pieces of information had two coefficients (one each for the equations for &lt;code&gt;mu&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;phi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) the model I used had twenty parameters against 3111 observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The source for the data is the same as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/2016/12/18/a-different-kind-of-political-geography/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt;, and is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Deleetdk/USA.county.data&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;available and described here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;BUGS&lt;/code&gt; model code is below: (all of the code is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tvladeck/beta_binomial_county_model&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the model code is in the file &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tvladeck/beta_binomial_county_model/blob/master/county_binom_model.bugs.R&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;county_binom_model.bugs.R&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[gist]https://gist.github.com/tvladeck/f050e1e4e398f91dc48b73723e72c1a5[/gist]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Model results / validation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model performs very well on first inspection, especially when we take the log of the actual votes and the prediction (upper right plot), and even more so when we do that and restrict it only to counties with greater than 20,000 votes (lower left plot):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/actual_v_estimate.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-505&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/actual_v_estimate.svg&quot; alt=&quot;actual_v_estimate&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is actually cheating a bit, since the number of votes &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; HRC (which the model is fitting) in any county is constrained by the number of votes overall. Here’s a plot showing the estimated proportion vs. the actual proportion of votes for HRC, weighted by the number of votes overall:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/proportions_plot.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-506&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/proportions_plot.svg&quot; alt=&quot;proportions_plot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the plot of coefficients for &lt;code&gt;mu&lt;/code&gt; (the average propensity within a county):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mu_coefs_plot.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-507&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mu_coefs_plot.svg&quot; alt=&quot;mu_coefs_plot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All else being equal, coefficients to the left of the vertical bar helped Trump, and to the right helped Clinton. As we can see, since more Democratic support is concentrated in dense urban areas, there are many more &lt;strong&gt;counties&lt;/strong&gt; that supported Trump, so the intercept is far to the left. Unsurprisingly (but perhaps sadly) &lt;code&gt;whiteness&lt;/code&gt; was the strongest predictor overall and was very strong for Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the rate of &lt;code&gt;uninsurance&lt;/code&gt; was a relatively strong predictor for Trump support, and &lt;code&gt;diabetes&lt;/code&gt; (a proxy for overall health) was a smaller but significant factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic factors (&lt;code&gt;income&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gini&lt;/code&gt; / income inequality, and &lt;code&gt;unemployment&lt;/code&gt;) were either not a factor or predicted support for Clinton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The effects on polarity can be seen here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/phi_coefs_plot.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-508&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/phi_coefs_plot.svg&quot; alt=&quot;phi_coefs_plot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we can see here (as the intercept is far to the right) is that most individual counties have a fairly uniform voter base. High rates of &lt;code&gt;diabetes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;whiteness&lt;/code&gt; predict high uniformity, and basically nothing except for &lt;code&gt;income inequality&lt;/code&gt; predicts diversity in voting patterns (and this is unsurprising).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is also striking is that we can map &lt;code&gt;mu&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;phi&lt;/code&gt; against each other. This is a plot of “uniformity” - how similar voting preferences are within a county vs. “propensity” - the average direction a vote will go within a county. In this graph, &lt;code&gt;mu&lt;/code&gt; is on the y axis, and &lt;code&gt;log(phi)&lt;/code&gt; is on the x axis, and the size of a county is represented by the size of a circle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/propensity_uniformity.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-509&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/propensity_uniformity.svg&quot; alt=&quot;propensity_uniformity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we see is a positive relationship between support for Trump and uniformity within a county and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you’re interested in bayesian inference using gibbs sampling, here are the trace plots for the parameters to show they converged nicely: &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mu_trace.jpeg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;mu trace&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/phi_trace.jpeg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;phi trace&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion and potential next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This modeling approach has the advantage of closely approximating the underlying dynamics of voting, and the plots showing the actual outcome vs. predicted outcome show the model has pretty good fit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also shows that whiteness was a major driver of Trump support, and that economic factors on their own were decidedly &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a factor in supporting Trump. If anything, they predicted support for Clinton. It also provides an interesting way of directly modeling unit-level (in this case, county-level) uniformity / polarity among the electorate. This approach could perhaps be of use in better identifying “swing counties” (or at least a different approach in identifying them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This modeling approach can be extended in an number of interesting ways. For example, instead of using a beta-binomial distribution to model two-way voting patterns, we could use a dirichlet-multinomial distribution (basically, the extension of beta-binomial to more than 2 possible outcomes) to model voting patterns across all candidates (including Libertarian and Green), and even flexibly model turnout by including not voting as an outcome in the distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could build similar regressions for past elections and see how coefficients have changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could even match voting records across the ‘12 and ‘16 elections to make inferences about the components of the county-level vote swing: voters flipping their vote, voting in ‘12 and not voting in ‘16, or not voting in ‘12 and then voting in ‘16 - and which candidate they came to support.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The importance of model thinking</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2016/12/26/the-importance-of-model-thinking/"/>
   <updated>2016-12-26T15:30:35-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2016/12/26/the-importance-of-model-thinking</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day, I got into a weird argument with my cousin (who is among the smartest people I know). We were discussing Sam Wang, the Princeton professor who runs the &lt;a href=&quot;http://election.princeton.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Princeton Election Consortium&lt;/a&gt; (PEC). Of the well-known prognosticators about the election, Dr. Wang was the most wrong, with his site estimating a probability of HRC winning to be over 99%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My cousin was arguing that the results eliminated Dr. Wang’s credibility in this field and that we basically shouldn’t be listening to him any longer. Because he had been so spectacularly wrong, why should he be trusted again?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is wrong, and why it’s wrong is important in the discourse of ideas. First, Dr. Wang wasn’t reporting that he himself was estimating these odds for HRC, he was &lt;strong&gt;reporting&lt;/strong&gt; that his &lt;strong&gt;model&lt;/strong&gt; was outputting these estimates. This is an important distinction. He may have been convinced by the statistical model he was referring to, and he may have also believed its reported estimates, but what’s important for these purposes is that he was reporting the results of an independent model, &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; simply saying that’s what he believed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certainly&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;model&lt;/strong&gt; that the PEC had been using has lost its credibility. We now know that it didn’t properly incorporate correlated error in the outcomes at the state level (e.g. a miss in PA making a miss in MI and WI more likely), and it underestimated the distribution of overall polling bias. We shouldn’t use it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if Dr. Wang creates a new model that corrects for these mistakes? How now should we take my cousin’s advice to disregard Dr. Wang? Do we not even bother with the new model since the source is tainted by the previous election results? Do we inspect the model independently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see here that my cousin’s advice doesn’t make much sense if you treat the model and its author separately. Clearly the new model must be treated on its own merits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this gets at a deeper question. What is a recommendation, a forecast, and estimate, an analysis, etc., &lt;strong&gt;without&lt;/strong&gt; a model? The answer is that there is &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; a model, because there is &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; some kind of computation that leads to the end result, even if that computation is taking place entirely within the neural circuitry of the analyst. In these cases, when people simply come to their own conclusions, the author and the model are one and the same. There are no equations, parameters, logical relations, etc., that observers can evaluate and see if the specification does or does not make sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Dr. Wang had not made his model explicit and had simply been reporting his own estimates, then my cousin perhaps would have been right. In this world, the logic would go something like this: his (Dr. Wang’s) model turned out to be bad, and his model was him, so disregarding his model and disregarding him are one and the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this of course was not the case, and this is why it is so important to think in terms of explicit models. If you don’t have a model in mind facing something in the real world, it’s not even clear to me how you update your knowledge, aside from adding an additional memory to your bank of heuristics. When you understand how a model functions - the relationships between its several parts - you can adapt and improve it in the face of real-world experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Three reasons to be a raving lunatic about Trump</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2016/12/19/three-reasons-to-be-a-raving-lunatic-about-trump/"/>
   <updated>2016-12-19T14:34:41-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2016/12/19/three-reasons-to-be-a-raving-lunatic-about-trump</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other night, my mind was literally 💥 when two of my very smart friends challenged me on the idea that Trump being elected president was &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the worst thing to happen in 2016. To me - it’s an absolute no-brainer, and a conclusion that even a little imagination combined with historical knowledge would usher you to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess in part it depends on how bad you think things could get; I think the worst cases are so bad that it’s driven me to become a raving lunatic. Here’s why I think you should be one too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International Conflict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is especially salient given the murder of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-38369962?SThisFB&quot;&gt;Russian ambassador to Turkey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matthew White calls the beginning of the 20th Century the “Hemoclysm” - literally, blood flood - because of the staggeringly large conflicts and loss of life. WWI, WWII, the Holocaust, the Great Purge, and two nuclear bombs all happened during this time. How did this era begin? As Steven Pinker puts it in The Better Angels of our Nature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The war was a perfect storm of destructive currents, brought suddenly together by the iron dice of Mars: an ideological background of militarism and nationalism, a sudden contest of honor that threatened the credibility of each of the great powers, a Hobbesian trap that frightened leaders into attacking before they were attacked first, an overconfidence that deluded each of them into thinking that victory would come swiftly, military machines that could deliver massive quantities of men to a front that could mow them down as quickly as they arrived, and a game of attrition that locked the two sides into sinking exponentially greater costs into a ruinous situation - &lt;strong&gt;all set off by a Serbian nationalist who had a lucky day&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a fragile world. The complexities of international diplomacy are enormous, and the consequences can be more severe than we can imagine. And Trump has shown himself to be quite willing to fly by the seat of his pants on things like the One China policy, our support of NATO, and just bombing the shit out of wherever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The President’s #1 job is to keep America safe. This is not as simple as battening down the hatches and keeping “America First”; it involves real, nuanced thinking about how to carefully deploy threats, when to back them up, and when to offer the olive branch. Are we going to get anything close to that with Trump? Don’t tell me he has good advisers - all the easy decisions get made before they get to the oval office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Norms of American Democracy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we have a Constitution that is the ultimate source of law in this country, most of what makes our system of government actually so great is that our leaders respect norms regarding the use and transfer of power. When incumbents lose, they leave office! When candidates lose, they concede! Until, maybe, now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, candidates for higher office have been careful to make clear that they have no conflicts of interest (say, by releasing their tax returns) and that they are acting in the interest of the country (at least according to their worldview).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trump has done the exact opposite of all this. He refused to say he’d concede in the event of a loss. He hasn’t released his tax returns. His businesses present a bewildering array of conflicts of interest. He’s installing his family (who are managing his businesses) as his closest confidantes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, putting aside whether any of this is illegal, it certainly screws up the incentives in our country. The way to succeed becomes to curry favor with the government. This is how countries become Russia - a sham democracy and a corrupt kleptocracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then of course there’s the lying. So much lying. Like, for instance, that he had one of the largest electoral college wins (his was one of the smallest); or that the murder rates are the highest they’ve been in decades (they’re the lowest). Politicians lie, have always done so, and will always do so. But - at least in the USA - their lies at least maintain respect for the truth, as they’re couched in euphemisms or misdirection. Trump has no respect for the truth. His lies are so easy to fact-check that it’s hard to escape the impression that for him, lies like this are a much a demonstration of domination (“look how easily and bigly I can lie and you can’t do anything about it”) as anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Degrading the norms of our republic - as Trump has done and seems to be intent on continuing to do - is one way to start ending the great American experiment in democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While certainly not as sexy a way to go out as a nuclear war, climate change poses a similar kind of existential threat. We need a president that can at least recognize the science and the tradeoffs that come with different forms of climate policy - not someone who has once dismissed it as a “Chinese hoax”, or who puts a climate denier in charge of the EPA, or who puts a man who once forgot, in a nationally televised debate, the third federal department that he’d like to eliminate, in charge of said department - the Department of Energy, whose original mandate is to safeguard our stockpile of nuclear waste. What kind of thinking puts a man who’s famous for saying “oops” in charge of that department?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe raving lunatic was not the right word - you have to be taken seriously at the end of the day. But we should be uncomfortable about all this. We can’t let our vigilance slide and allow this (tax returns, the family posse rolling up to the White House, shattering of stable alliances, abuses on twitter, the &lt;strong&gt;lying&lt;/strong&gt; etc.) to feel normal. Like the proverbial frog in the pot of increasingly-hot water, we can’t just let our government crumble around us and say “this is fine”. It’s &lt;em&gt;exhausting&lt;/em&gt;, but we can’t get tired of calling Trump and his enablers out. As Voltaire said:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A different kind of political geography</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2016/12/18/a-different-kind-of-political-geography/"/>
   <updated>2016-12-18T11:34:09-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2016/12/18/a-different-kind-of-political-geography</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the surprising (to say the least) electoral result I initiated a few projects to try and understand the politics of the country. One thing I wanted to understand was the impact of demographic and underlying situational variables (e.g. health, income, unemployment, etc.) on how people voted. Was the vote about Obamacare? Was it about lost jobs? Was it all education levels? Or was it all racism? Theories have been floated but I haven’t seen a rigorous evaluation of these hypotheses. What’s below is just an exploratory analysis, but the data does point in some interesting directions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows below are a series of visualizations of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Deleetdk/USA.county.data&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;large, aggregated dataset of both demographic, situational, and electoral data&lt;/a&gt;. Sources for the demographic and situational data are listed &lt;a href=&quot;https://openpsych.net/paper/12&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and the electoral data is from the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The type of visualization is called a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;self organized map&lt;/a&gt;. Roughly speaking, each hexagon is a group of counties; the map arranges the counties such that similar ones are closer to each other on the map and dissimilar ones further apart:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hs_diploma-1.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-513&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/hs_diploma-1.svg&quot; alt=&quot;hs_diploma&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For any given variable (here - the proportion of residents in the counties that graduated from high school) the map is a heatmap. Redder colors means the counties index higher, bluer means they index lower. Here, the upper right are the counties where fewer people have a high school diploma, and lower left are the most educated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All of the maps shown below are available at &lt;a href=&quot;https://gradient.shinyapps.io/geography_of_voting/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this interactive site&lt;/a&gt;. (A very similar set of maps, but for voting swings as opposed to voting share, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gradient.shinyapps.io/geography_of_swings/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;is available here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, we look at the voting share for Hillary. The counties are arranged in the same way as above, but since we’re looking at different variable the map is colored differently. (Confusingly, more votes for HRC are red as opposed to the customary blue for liberals, but work with me here). The reason this map is more organized than the rest is that I used this variable to “supervise” the organization (don’t worry about the details of this - basically it just guaranteed that this particular coloring, which is the reference point, would be organized.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/base_plot.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-512&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/base_plot.svg&quot; alt=&quot;base_plot&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have the basics in place, we can look at other variables: let’s check a few variables and see if they line up w/ the HRC voting share map. What we can do is draw a boundary around the areas that went strongly for Trump and for HRC like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/base_plot_w_annotation.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-514&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/base_plot_w_annotation.svg&quot; alt=&quot;base_plot_w_annotation&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And we’ll keep these annotations throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health and insurance:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The breakdowns for uninsurance and health variables like obesity and diabetes don’t break down along electoral lines: the split goes in the opposite direction, with the highest uninsurance and low health areas going to both candidates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/uninsured.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-515&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/uninsured.svg&quot; alt=&quot;uninsured&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/adult_obesity.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-516&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/adult_obesity.svg&quot; alt=&quot;adult_obesity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/diabetes.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-517&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/diabetes.svg&quot; alt=&quot;diabetes&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economic variables:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These graphs should put the “economic anxiety” argument to rest, as the areas with highest unemployment went strongest to HRC and those with the least went strongest to Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unemploymen.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-518&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/unemploymen.svg&quot; alt=&quot;unemploymen&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/earnings.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-519&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/earnings.svg&quot; alt=&quot;earnings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ethnic Variables:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few graphs line up pretty well: whiteness and ethnic homogeneity. And whiteness and ethnic homogeneity line up basically on top of each other. This would support the hypothesis that the election for Trump was mainly a cultural (and not a policy) event; white enclaves are reacting against a diminishing place in the cultural landscape - hence the making things great &lt;strong&gt;again&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/whiteness.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-520&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/whiteness.svg&quot; alt=&quot;whiteness&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/homogeneity.svg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-521&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/homogeneity.svg&quot; alt=&quot;homogeneity&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See for yourself: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tvladeck/election_som&quot;&gt;My code is available here&lt;/a&gt; (it is not very well commented or formatted, but it’s there).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, &lt;a href=&quot;https://gradient.shinyapps.io/geography_of_voting/&quot;&gt;all the maps above are available at this site&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to see something similar but with voting &lt;strong&gt;swings&lt;/strong&gt; - the amount the county changed their vote from ‘12 to ‘16, you can see that &lt;a href=&quot;https://gradient.shinyapps.io/geography_of_swings/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Inauguration Day Fundraiser</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2016/11/12/inauguration-day-fundraiser/"/>
   <updated>2016-11-12T14:57:52-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2016/11/12/inauguration-day-fundraiser</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I sent this email to a group of my friends that live in NYC. If you live in the area and want to help organize, let me know at thomas.vladeck@gmail.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friends,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re like me you’re shocked about what happened on election day. I can’t believe our country decided to put that orange-skinned, pussy-grabbing, bankrupt con artist that’s likely an agent of the Russian government into the Oval Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As bad as it is now, he’s not in office yet. And as unpredictable as he is, we have no idea what to expect he’ll do when he gets there (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/uhpo1jrj4nt6d2f/Screenshot%202016-11-12%2011.40.26.png?dl=0&quot;&gt;see these two back-to-back tweets as he does a real-time A/B test of governing styles&lt;/a&gt;), but it likely won’t be good. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/14/politics/newt-gingrich-house-un-american-activities-committee/&quot;&gt;One of his top lieutenants already proposed bringing back the House Un-American Activities Committee&lt;/a&gt; (a black stain on the history of American Civil Liberties), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/if-donald-trump-implements-his-proposed-policies-well-see-him-court&quot;&gt;if he implements his campaign proposals to remove 11 million immigrants, ban muslims, punish women for having abortions, reinstate waterboarding, and change our libel and slander laws - he’ll be violating the first, fourth, fifth, eighth, and 14th amendments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to mention &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-36401174&quot;&gt;he’s planning to rip up the watershed Paris Accords&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en&quot;&gt;makes sense as Climate Change is a Chinese hoax…&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/climate-trends-continue-to-break-records&quot;&gt;in a year that has seen every indicator of Global Warming reach dizzying new heights&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the subject of existential threats, it’s becoming clear where the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/22/michael-morell/experts-say-donald-trumps-policies-dovetail-what-v/&quot;&gt;suspiciously pro-Russia policies of the Trump campaign&lt;/a&gt; came from, as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/moscow-had-contacts-with-trump-team-during-campaign-russian-diplomat-says/2016/11/10/28fb82fa-a73d-11e6-9bd6-184ab22d218e_story.html&quot;&gt;Russian diplomats had been in contact with the Trump campaign throughout&lt;/a&gt;. This at a time that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/nato-ground-troops-high-alert-russia-tensions-baltic-latvia-lithuania-estonia-a7402136.html&quot;&gt;NATO has put &lt;b&gt;three hundred thousand&lt;/b&gt; ground troops on high alert&lt;/a&gt; because of a feared confrontation with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but I’m probably going to be a wreck on inauguration day (January 20th). Instead of just watching, let’s do something. And that something we should do is &lt;b&gt;party together&lt;/b&gt;, raising money for organizations that are going to fight these abhorrences tooth and nail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’m thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We rent out a space&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We invite all our friends&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;We have a great time&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Some great groups get some needed cash to keep the fight going&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who’s in?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tom&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Re: the election</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2016/11/09/election/"/>
   <updated>2016-11-09T07:11:08-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2016/11/09/election</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h4 style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;I owe many people an apology today. I was extremely confident that HRC had this election in the bag and presumptuously advertised this confidence over the past weeks, dismissing any thought that she would lose. It wasn't an act, and it has made it all the more devastating to me now that she has in fact lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Because of my work with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gradientmetrics.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Gradient&lt;/a&gt;, which does statistical modeling in a business setting, over this cycle a lot of people have asked me for my interpretation of the various forecasting models. When discussing it with them, I was bullish, overconfident, and as it turns out, terribly wrong. I feel terrible for giving people this false impression of security and making the result any more jarring and devastating than it already is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;What was I wrong about? Well, mostly everything - but two very large things stand out: polling bias and the correlation of polling errors. In general there are two types of statistical error: bias and variance. Variance is when you're dancing around the right result - any one measurement is off but on average the errors cancel out; bias is when the errors don't cancel. Polling bias (even state polls) in presidential elections has been estimated over many cycles, and has typically been small (about 1%). What polling bias means in concrete terms is that many more people voted for Trump than the polls captured; there was a social movement happening in front of our eyes but that did not show up in the data. I trusted the data and did not foresee the possibility that the polling bias would be so large across the board in swing states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;That leads to the next point. State results are obviously correlated - blue and red states tend to vote together. This means too that polls of states should be correlated. So outcomes and the measurements of those outcomes should be correlated - but should &lt;em&gt;errors&lt;/em&gt; be correlated? I had no reason to think so. For example, polls had HRC ahead in Michigan and Wisconsin; I thought that all the correlation between the two would be captured by the correlated polling results across the two states. I did not think that a polling error in one state meant that a polling error in the same direction in the other state was more likely. It is obvious now that this was the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;This election is going to prompt a rethink across the entire polling and data analysis industry - myself very much included, even though politics is not my professional remit. But that's small potatoes compared to the vastly more consequential implications of this election: climate change; respect for women, immigrants, and muslims; the supreme court; our security and trade relationships around the world; the nuclear codes, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;As for what happens next, I hope you agree with me that it's critical that we stay engaged with our country's politics as opposed to recoiling in horror. Quite literally, I think our country needs us and people like us to fight tooth and nail to preserve our vision of what America is and what makes it great.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Introduction to the Timespace Map of New York</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2015/09/05/introduction-to-the-timespace-map-of-new-york/"/>
   <updated>2015-09-05T15:50:17-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2015/09/05/introduction-to-the-timespace-map-of-new-york</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[2017-12-07: &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.gradientmetrics.com/2017/12/07/new-york-city-in-timespace/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This has been updated in a big way&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer I lived in New York for the first time, working for Venmo. Venmo’s offices are in the West Village, and I lived in Park Slope, so every day I would take the F train. As I was getting to know the city I would often look at this map:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Official_New_York_City_Subway_Map_vc.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone&quot; src=&quot;https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Official_New_York_City_Subway_Map_vc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;278&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at that map every day got me thinking that so much of the geography of the city was defined by its public transit infrastructure, not by the lay of the land. What determined if two points were practically far or close depended not on how many miles separated them, or natural features like rivers that may lay between them, but whether or not it was easy to get from one place to the other on public transit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started thinking about how we could make a new map of New York, where distances between points on the map would reflect how &lt;strong&gt;long&lt;/strong&gt; it took to get between them, not how &lt;strong&gt;far&lt;/strong&gt; apart they were. It would project time onto the two-dimensional space of the map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without knowing how I would do that, I started collecting data. I took the 195 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/bytes/nynta_metadata.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;neighborhood tabulation areas&lt;/a&gt; of New York, geocoded them into Lat/Long pairs, and started hitting &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/intro&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Google’s Directions API&lt;/a&gt; for each of the pairs of neighborhoods to see how long the transit route between them took. After doing this over many days in batches (because Google limits how many directions you can ask for any given day), I had a distance matrix that looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screenshot-2015-09-05-15.20.20.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-351 &quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screenshot-2015-09-05-15.20.20.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2015-09-05 15.20.20&quot; width=&quot;769&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the cells being the time (in seconds) it took to get between the two locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I needed to figure out how to lay out these points in a two-dimensional space that reflected these distances in time. Turns out, this is a common problem in data visualization, and the most common tool is called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_scaling&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;multidimensional scaling&lt;/a&gt;. Running &lt;code&gt;cmdscale&lt;/code&gt; (in &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;) on my distance matrix allowed me to lay out the “neighborhoods” of New York onto a 2d map with distances between them reflecting time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With just this information, about the best I could do was to create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Voronoi diagram&lt;/a&gt; of the points scattered about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/voronoi.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-large wp-image-353&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/voronoi-1024x1024.png&quot; alt=&quot;voronoi&quot; width=&quot;525&quot; height=&quot;525&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cool, but we can do better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started thinking about these 195 points as a “skeleton” that I could build on. I wanted to project more information onto this map, but I couldn’t just go on adding points to my distance matrix (since the number of entries in the distance matrix goes up with the square of the number of neighborhoods), I had to figure out how to project an arbitrary Lat/Long pair onto this map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried a few things out, but the method I settled on was &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;LOESS regression&lt;/a&gt; as it was simple, made few assumptions, and could handle the obvious nonlinearities in the transformation between Lat/Long space and Timespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model was simple (this is the model to predict one axis of the timespace dimension):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt; model.dim1 &amp;lt;- loess(data = model.data,
formula = dim1 ~ lat + lng,
degree = 2,
span = span)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the &lt;code&gt;span&lt;/code&gt; term allows you to control how much impact the skeleton points have in “pulling” the new Lat/Long points away from their starting point. Here is a gif of different projections of the five boroughs with &lt;code&gt;spans&lt;/code&gt; ranging from &lt;code&gt;0.99&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;0.2&lt;/code&gt;: (there a few errors in the borough shapefiles that I’m aware of…)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/animation2.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone wp-image-355 size-full&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/animation2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;animation2&quot; width=&quot;2625&quot; height=&quot;2625&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, now that I have a method of projecting arbitrary Lat/Long pairs onto the “Timespace” dimension, I am working on doing it with other data sources. I’m starting with subways, but plan to add other features like roads, parks, and the like. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Variations on a theme</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/08/03/variations-on-a-theme/"/>
   <updated>2014-08-03T10:47:19-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/08/03/variations-on-a-theme</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anyone that knows me has probably noticed that over the past year-plus, I have gotten into photography in a major way. But as much as I post photos, I spend about as much time ogling the photos of more talented and able photographers. One thing I noticed is that the best photographers tend to have a very specific style - for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/randypmartin/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Randy Martin&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a perfectly centered subject in a larger scene; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://instagram.com/micpic&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Michael Goldberg&lt;/a&gt;, it’s close-ups on the street using flash to illuminate his subject’s imperfections; for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/NguanPhotography/photos_stream&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nguan&lt;/a&gt;, it’s warmly-lit subjects lost in a moment of ennui.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;I guess this shouldn’t be too much of a surprise, as variations on a theme are the rule in other forms of art, like music (bands have a sound that cuts across their songs/albums), movies (wes anderson), paintings (dali), etc. I want each photo to stand on its own and be considered in its own right, and I want the ability to take any photo that I think is compelling for whatever reason. But that’s not how it works; your audience (whoever that is and however many people that is) wants something familiar as well as novel and interesting. Perhaps it’s the commonality between your works establishes a common ground with your audience and without a familiar “vocabulary” they would lack the basis to appreciate the work - but I’m just speculating. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t (yet) have a style. Or at least not one that I’m aware of. Perhaps it takes time to find what you like. Perhaps it takes time to develop the skills that allow you to impose your style on the scene in front of you. I really don’t know! But it’s on my mind this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Capital in the Twenty First Century</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/07/11/capital-in-the-twenty-first-century/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-11T07:01:46-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/07/11/capital-in-the-twenty-first-century</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ll confess I didn’t finish it (audible tells me I made it about three-quarters through). It is, however, a great book, but it does not make for great listening. This one (and it is the first book I’ve thought this about) really should be read on paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central thesis of the book is that the return on capital generally exceeds the rate of economic growth, and when economic growth is slow (as it has been for much of human history) that this leads to a natural tendency for societies to develop extreme inequality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve long had a “rich-get-richer” argument playing out in my head, but through a slightly different mechanism, which plays out like this: as people get wealthier, their ability to take risk with their capital increases; as this “risk appetite” increases, they are able to devote a more substantial share of their capital to higher-risk assets with a higher expected return; this, then, would lead to a higher overall return to their investments. Think of a person initially holding only cash, then saving up enough money for a down payment on a home, and then to investing their savings in liquid stocks and bonds. Each class of investment (cash, real estate, equities) is riskier and higher-returning than the last, and this sequence leads to an increasing return on increasing capital. Wealthier people are invested in all these asset classes and more, such as hedge funds or privately-held companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it was no surprise to me that there should be runaway effects to wealth inequality. But the rationale Piketty lays out are quite different. I must confess that I did not completely understand the reasons that returns to capital (as a whole, not the varying allocations of capital that I describe above) ought to generally be at a rate faster than economic growth. But the data show convincingly that it is now, and has usually been so. The result is runaway wealth inequality that has only been tempered throughout human history by capital-destroying calamities, such as world wars, that bring people back to an equal footing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Piketty really succeeds, if you ask me, is in linking this argument to the literature describing the extremely stratified societies of, for example, Victorian England. He saying “watch out, these crazy societies could one day be reborn”. I hope he’s wrong, but he’s given ample reason to fear that he might be right.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Review of Lean In</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/07/09/review-of-lean-in/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-09T07:00:58-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/07/09/review-of-lean-in</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I finished listening to &lt;em&gt;Lean In&lt;/em&gt;, which you should probably Google if you don’t already know it. I listened to it as part of a college-friend-audible-book-listening-club, and kept some thoughts about the book as I listened on. Here they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is one key theme to the book that deserves singling-out, it is the focus on the individual woman as the unit of analysis. Sandberg’s book, when it’s all boiled down, is a entreaty to women, as individuals, to consider a fuller range of career and family options, and gives many “how-tos” regarding how to accomplish some of the tougher options. She is basically saying “You, promising young woman, here is what you have against you and how you can best navigate it”. So although she does pronounce some big goals, such as 50/50 splits in the executive ranks everywhere, her book is emphatically not about what policy needs to do to change things. This is a pragmatic manifesto which aims to give women more tools to confront, as individuals, the institutional sexism that impedes their career progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to get an MBA quite soon, so I’m a sympathetic audience for career-enhancing tips, and I found much of her advice quite applicable as well as useful. Perhaps sadly, though, much of her advice is either not gender specific or only applicable to elites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sandberg’s advice can be broken down into two categories: that aimed at helping women more adeptly confront sexist barriers in their professional lives, and that aimed at helping women to make choices that balance their professional and personal lives. For the former, most of this material is, when one really gets down to it, applicable in equal parts for men For example, when outlining the differing negotiating strategies of men and women, the advice that she gives to her female readers is to use tactics that are, in their essence, a subset of the “principled negotiation” methods outlined in &lt;i&gt;Getting to Yes. &lt;/i&gt;Men, too, would be well advised to adopt state-of-the-art bargaining methods, not to mention develop relationships with mentors, and to have some thoughts about their future careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Sandberg is absolutely right to attack the stigma placed on working mothers from all sides (showing, for example, that children with home care from nannies develop just as well and have just as healthy a relationship with their mothers as those raised by full-time moms. I, for one, am one of these children, so I should hope so.), it is just not the case that many women are in a position to consider many of the options that Sandberg urges her audience to feel better about, such as working more flexible hours or having a nanny. Sandberg acknowledges this, and this does not affect the efficacy of her argument; it does, however, limit its scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most powerful part of the book is Sandberg’s entreaty to women not to put their foot on the brakes of their professional lives until they are indeed confronted with hard tradeoffs. The point of the practical portions of the book being, of course, tools to give women a better set of options in these dilemmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book is littered with references to studies and much of its summarized research is quite compelling. Sandberg erred, though, in making her argument for the motivation of the book; namely, that women’s progress infiltrating all strata of professional ranks had stalled. Her data, which were only long-term statistics, only showed that progress was not yet complete, not that it had slowed down. This mishandling of the data led me to approach the rest of her citations with a more skeptical eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an interesting book, but far more so for its cultural cache than the material inside.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What I&#8217;m looking for at Wharton</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/07/06/what-im-looking-for-at-wharton/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-06T05:00:36-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/07/06/what-im-looking-for-at-wharton</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;After we shut down &lt;a href=&quot;http://buildinghero.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Building Hero&lt;/a&gt;, my career goals were pretty simple: start and launch new products and businesses. My analysis led me to conclude that this happens in essentially two ways: (a) as an independent entrepreneur and (b) as a product manager (or similar role), usually within tech companies - after all, big companies launch new products all the time. After taking as many coffees as possible, putting out a few feelers, I concluded that (b) was going to be a very tough role to land with my background. And for (a), despite working on Building Hero for two years, I never built up a deep network in tech; I explored an idea for about a month but concluded that I didn’t have either a strong idea to build on nor a network in tech to leverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I concluded that business school would be a good chance to learn many of the basics of business-building and the product development process, build a great network alongside a world-class cohort of people, and that my degree would provide me with significant reputational capital. In addition - and I didn’t articulate this beforehand - I think the two years at business school will be a great opportunity to create new things with the resources available to students (not least the amazing cohort of fellow classmates).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On August 4th, I’ll start the first of two years getting an MBA at Wharton. One of the pieces of advice they give you when you’re a matriculating MBA student at a school like Wharton is to take some time to really think about what you want to get out of it, because there will be so many potential demands on your time. So as I’m winding down my current job, I’ve started to think about what I want to get out of the whole experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, I list out the overview of what I want to achieve, broken down into the following categories: academics, community, leadership, personal branding, and finally, some specific plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Academics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, academics are one of the four core reasons I decided business school would be a good choice for me. I actually probably weight academics more strongly than most other matriculating students; I’ve experienced firsthand what it’s like to try and build a business without working mental models, and it was a tough experience in which I usually felt lost. Only late in the experience when I started taking classes on product development and reading more widely on the subject did I realize how lost I truly was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, a true accounting of my skills would rate me a bit behind the curve in many basic business categories. I’m most excited about classes on product development, entrepreneurial management, marketing, and leadership - as they relate most directly to my career interests - but I’m also excited to get a basic education in finance, operations management, and accounting. So - the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greatest value in business school is probably in the cohort. It certainly felt that way when I got to meet my future classmates this past Spring at Welcome Weekend. So it would be a crime not to find ways to maximize that experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clubs are a big part of business school - both in terms of the career development process and the social scene. Career-wise, the Entrepreneurship and Technology clubs align most closely with my goals. I am going to check out the Marketing and Design clubs as well, but as long as my career goals don’t change it’s seems relatively certain that the Entrepreneurship and Tech clubs will get the majority of my attention. Socially, the Photography and Climbing clubs map perfectly to my current outside hobby interests, but who knows what will gel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, I’d like to find ways to engage with both the Wharton and the Philadelphia communities outside of traditional channels. (There is a specific Wharton-led opportunity in this area that I am super-interested in, though.) My roommate and I discussed creating a sort of lifestyle/community email newsletter that we’d curate. We’ll see about that - but I’d like to get involved in something that isn’t just put out on a platter by the school. Which takes me to…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Starting Something (and &quot;Leadership&quot;)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leadership really is a separate category, containing elements of specific training, academic learning (i.e. the mechanics of emotional contagion), and, I dunno, just having to &lt;strong&gt;be&lt;/strong&gt; a leader. My career ambitions put me at the top of organizational structures by definition (i.e. I’m not looking to be a hugely successful investor), so this is a very important skill to develop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some specific leadership programs offered by Wharton which I’ll get to below, but &lt;strong&gt;my number one goal at Wharton is to start &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;Right now I’m agnostic on what that will be; it could be a new club on campus, a civic organization, a company, or even “just” an event. But this is an important goal to me; at the very least I want the practice of creating something out of nothing, and I don’t want to let a prime time and a litany of resources for doing so go to waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Personal Brand&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Careers are changing - everyone knows that the days of working for years at a single company or organization are gone. As Reid Hoffman &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.babson.edu/news-events/events/commencement/recap/pages/reid-hoffman.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;puts it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #333333;&quot;&gt;Whereas we used to have a career ladder, now we have a career jungle gym. Success in a career is no longer a simple ascension on a path of steps. You need to climb sideways and sometimes down; sometimes you need to swing and jump from one set of bars to the next. And, to extend the metaphor, sometimes you need to spring from the jungle gym and establish your own turf somewhere else on the playground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value, then, of a personal brand is paramount, as your environment will constantly be changing throughout your career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve got two primary goals for my personal brand: (a) build a fantastic network while I’m at the school, and (b) to keep writing and use my blog as a tool to promote myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My view is that connections are best formed organically; trying to network has never been my thing, but when you actually have things going on - you’re trying to get an event off the ground, you’re building a company, you’re writing a blog post, etc. - the people that you reach out to to collaborate with often become friends and future collaborators. So I’m not necessarily going to devote time to this specifically, but my hope is that Wharton will provide a fertile environment for my network to grow as a form of “exhaust” from all the other shit I’ll be trying to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realized that I really enjoyed writing, and that the process of writing really helped me distill and structure my thoughts, during the time I was putting together sixteen application essays for business school; these essays dealt with serious topics about my life and future ambitions, and they helped me form a vision for the future. So I love writing on this blog, and at the same time, having a well-articulated point-of-view on relevant topics is a great way to establish credibility with other people. So I’m going to write on this blog more regularly (my goal is to post twice/week) and to promote it more heavily. I have readership and engagement goals, but I won’t share those for now. I may have to establish a more consistent theme, but this is something I’ll worry about later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Specifics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of specifics, I will almost certainly look to get an internship in tech over next summer, which most likely means I will be getting involved heavily in the tech club early on. My view at the moment is that this kind of internship will provide me with the most relevant training and the right kind of optionality to either start a company or to gun for a product manager/product marketing manager role after school. I imagine I will be competing with a number of students with similar career goals, so it will make differentiating through personal initiatives all-the-more important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many specific programs that Wharton offers; the ones that I’m interested in mainly fall into “leadership development” and “entrepreneurial resources”. On the leadership side, the programs that interest me the most at the moment are: the &lt;a href=&quot;wlp.wharton.upenn.edu/MBA/mba-venture-fellows.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Venture Fellows&lt;/a&gt; program, possibly because I did a 30-day NOLS mountaineering course, which was one of the most amazing and personal-growth-catalyzing experiences I’ve had; the &lt;a href=&quot;wlp.wharton.upenn.edu/MBA/nonprofit-board-leadership-pro.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Non-Profit Board leadership&lt;/a&gt; program - I work at in the non-profit space now, and recognize the inherent difficulties of running these organizations well, but at the same time am a huge believer that civic involvement is an important part of a well-led life; and their &lt;a href=&quot;wlp.wharton.upenn.edu/MBA/executive-coaching-and-feedback-program.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Executive Coaching&lt;/a&gt; program: growing up I played baseball for all of my youth, and had great coaches shape my development; I am excited to see how “coaching” - outside perspectives and regular feedback - works outside of the athletic setting. I see no reason why it should be much different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the entrepreneurial resources side, Wharton has a business plan competition, and a “venture initiation program”. It seems clear that at the very least for practice that I should enter the first; the latter, which is geared around providing resources to actually start a company, we’ll have to wait and see about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And just as importantly, some noes. I’m not particularly interested in applying to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wlp.wharton.upenn.edu/MBA/leadership-fellows.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Leadership Fellows&lt;/a&gt;. I can’t really articulate why, but it doesn’t really interest me off the bat. I’m similarly not interested in being on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mbawelcome.wharton.upenn.edu/welcome-events/welcome-committee/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Welcome Committee&lt;/a&gt; - in this case, although it seems interesting, it just doesn’t seem as interesting as many of the other opportunities available, so I’m going to deprioritize it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s the plan for now! I’m sure it will all change.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Facebook was right to run its test</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/07/01/facebook-was-right-to-run-its-test/"/>
   <updated>2014-07-01T14:10:54-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/07/01/facebook-was-right-to-run-its-test</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lately, there has been &lt;a href=&quot;http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/technology/facebook-tinkers-with-users-emotions-in-news-feed-experiment-stirring-outcry.html?partner=rss&amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes&amp;amp;_r=0&amp;amp;referrer=&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #042eee;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;an uproar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #042eee;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Facebook’s study on emotional contagion in a large number of users’ feeds&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The study seemed to indicate that Facebook had the ability to make people happier or sadder - that is, manipulate their emotions - by manipulating the content of their feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people don’t like the idea of being unwitting lab rats for experiments, or at the prospect of a corporation having the ability to control our thoughts and emotions, or just the danger of conducting such a study:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/laurenweinstein/status/483051171255312384&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;In my mind, however, these arguments rest on a faulty assumption, which is that Facebook isn’t already manipulating our emotions, at least by accident. Indeed, the studies done on this topic seem to suggest the opposite; Facebook already impacts its users’ emotions significantly. (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/22/facebook-study-envy_n_2526549.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #042eee;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21583593-using-social-network-seems-make-people-more-miserable-get-life&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #042eee;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;two&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.6;&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, Facebook has to use some algorithm to show content to its users. I think it’s a mistake to assume that there is a “neutral” scenario, especially when all evidence is to the contrary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/fmanjoo/status/483274496598482945&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then this issue really becomes a question of understanding what’s &lt;b&gt;already happening&lt;/b&gt;, not about doing something different qualitatively different, and it’s clear to me that in this frame Facebook should be conducting experiments like this (within limits, obviously).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The take by some, though, is that it’s not the experiment itself that’s troubling, but that it was conducted without its users knowing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/BenedictEvans/status/483105929433341952&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But again, if there really is no neutral scenario, and your emotions are going to be manipulated in any sort of consumption of Facebook, then even before any intentional tests have been done, you’ve already opted in to having your emotions manipulated. Indeed, you opted in when you started using Facebook, and every time you added something to your Facebook universe, via a like or added friend, you increased the scope of what could impact you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I’m glad Facebook is doing this research, and I’m really glad they’re publishing it for external consumption.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The risk dividend of renewable energy</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/06/25/the-risk-dividend-of-renewable-energy/"/>
   <updated>2014-06-25T11:43:35-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/06/25/the-risk-dividend-of-renewable-energy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Avoiding catastrophic climate change will require a transition of our energy system. Policymakers around the world spend their time look at different options for how this might be effected. They look at the rate of technological progress and the lessons of different policy experiments that have been tried around the world. The most important thing they care about is &lt;b&gt;cost&lt;/b&gt;, or how much in goods and services we’ll have to give up in order to make this transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One emerging point is that renewable energy has a largely-hidden, but potentially huge, benefit. It is much lower &lt;b&gt;risk&lt;/b&gt; than fossil fuel based power, and at a systemic level this could be a huge benefit to the economy. I’ll explain both below. (This is a very rough draft intended mostly to get my own thoughts in order).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we have to go on a tangent and discuss the role of risk and price in an economy. It is a truism that risk and return go together (i.e., with high returns comes high risk), so it is often stated that risk is a good thing, but this is a misleading conclusion. Risk is not good &lt;i&gt;per se. &lt;/i&gt;In fact, thinking of high returns as coming with high risk is actually a complete reversal of the process that leads to that fact: what happens is that for an investment that promises returns at &lt;b&gt;low&lt;/b&gt; risk, the price will get bid up until the returns are low as well. Investors are paying to avoid risk. Therefore, with all of the low risk investments promising low returns, the investments that offer high returns must therefore also have high risk. While risk itself is not a good thing (it comes with good things, namely high returns), it’s clear that the &lt;b&gt;ability&lt;/b&gt; to take risks is a good thing, as you can more easily go after high return investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what does this have to do with fossil fuels and renewable energy? Fossil fuel investments are very high risk. It’s not uncommon for an upstream oil and gas company to sink multiple billions of dollars into a well and have it not produce. There’s also a huge amount of geopolitical risk; Venezuela, Nigeria, Russia, Iraq, and Iran are major energy power. Finally, there’s simple market risk, which has to do with the highly complex interplay between investment and demand, leading to periods of over- and under-supply. This is part of the reason that fossil-fuel concerns generally make high profits - they are in a high risk business, so the profits have to be high to keep them in business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal or natural-gas fired power plants are exposed to these risks through volatile input prices for the fuel, which they must absorb. Renewable energy, by contrast, does not have to absorb this risk or anything like it. The input risks for wind- and solar-powered electricity are very small. They exist only in the initial estimation of the resource, and our techniques here have gotten quite good. When an investor plunks down her money for a solar-generation project, she has almost complete knowledge of how much it will produce over the the life of the project. And since financing costs make up 90% of the costs of this investment (since operating costs are minimal, as there are no fuel purchases), the entire cost structure of the investment is known beforehand. There is qualitatively less risk for renewable energy relative to fossil-fuel-powered generation, as renewable energy does not have input price risk. Financing costs for renewable energy are declining as investors become comfortable with the asset class, and business models emerge to allow more leverage in these investments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would be the benefit of taking this risk out of the system? Concretely, it would mean that all of the “risk capital” in the energy system - capital that investors put up, knowing they might lose it all - would be freed up and able to put to other uses. Instead of investors looking to the global energy system to take on risk and hopefully make a large return, they’d reallocate their&lt;b&gt; ability to take risk&lt;/b&gt; to other sectors of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the first order, reduction of risk for renewable energy investments should lead to lower capital costs, which will help them compete with fossil fuel generation. In the second order, risk reallocation should have some sort of positive dynamic effect in the economy, where the ability to take risk is freed up and put to use elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Fossil Fuel Divestment</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/05/15/fossil-fuel-divestment/"/>
   <updated>2014-05-15T17:15:53-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/05/15/fossil-fuel-divestment</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There was a great pair of articles recently in the New York Times discussing Stanford’s recent divestment from coal companies; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/10/opinion/why-divestment-fails.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;an op-ed stating the case that divestment would do little&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/opinion/why-divestment-can-be-successful.html?src=twrhp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a few responses to that argument&lt;/a&gt;. I think these articles really capture the debate. I agree with both sides: i.e. that &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/2013/01/05/is-socially-responsible-investing-worth-it/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the partial equilibrium of divestment should lead to absolutely zero impact on the targeted companies’ share price, profitability, or behavior&lt;/a&gt;. But divestment is a powerful political statement, not unlike a boycott.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s back up: one can make roughly three arguments in favor of divestment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;That it will reduce the share price of the targeted companies, increasing their cost of capital, in turn both reducing investment in the sector and increasing their cost of doing business.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;That the sector targeted for divestment is very high risk, so exposure needs to be curtailed. With respect to fossil fuels, this is the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_bubble&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;carbon bubble&lt;/a&gt;&quot; argument, which goes roughly like this: the current share prices of fossil fuel companies reflects a level of profitability they would only have if they burned more carbon than we can burn without frying Earth. So, the argument goes, eventually policy will step in and their valuations will crash.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Finally, there's the moral argument: you do not want your money invested in companies that do something you disagree with or find objectionable. Divesting, as Stanford has done, can be a powerful political statement. These political statements in turn can change the political environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s take on these arguments in turn: first, the argument that divestment on its own will reduce the level of activity by increasing the cost of doing business. The fundamental reason this doesn’t work is that for every seller, there’s a buyer. And there are many, many, many buyers that don’t give a fuck about anything moral, and will buy these fossil assets on the cheap and drive the price back up to where it was. But let’s even say you DID succeed in impacting the cost of capital and drive up the cost of doing business; this would just raise the marginal price, helping these companies finance new investments internally. And even if you made a few more heroic assumptions about the shape of the supply curve, etc. - most energy assets (especially in the oil market) are owned by governments, so capital market prices aren’t nearly as much of a factor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On to the carbon bubble: &lt;strong&gt;I certainly hope there is a carbon bubble.&lt;/strong&gt; I’ve devoted my young professional life to climate change, and it saddens me to think how little progress we’ve made. I hope that global policy comes around and puts fossil fuel companies out of business. &lt;em&gt;But, &lt;/em&gt;- so the question goes - &lt;em&gt;what about our financial system - don’t institutional investors depend on these companies to stay afloat?&lt;/em&gt; Well, yes and no. Exxon is the largest component of the S&amp;amp;P500, so it’s certainly going to be a part of many investment portfolios. Wouldn’t it a Bad Thing if it went bust? Well, not really. Here’s why: (a) if Exxon goes bankrupt, it’s because some other company is getting rich supplying the same energy services (i.e. Tesla), and (b) institutional investors are so widely diversified that they’ll own the “other side” of the energy transition. &lt;strong&gt;Exxon’s market value won’t disappear, it will be replaced. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the moral argument. This argument resonates with me, and I support those that make this decision. There is a tricky side to it, though, because if you’re selling for non-financial reasons (and therefore at below-market prices), you’re just creating economic opportunity for less-savory people. Think the Koch brothers buying a refinery on the cheap because you were divesting - you make a below-market return, the refinery doesn’t go offline, and the worst people ever make more than the buck they deserve. Not a great outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point to all this is that &lt;strong&gt;there is no substitute for policies that address the underlying value of fossil fuel use&lt;/strong&gt;. If it’s more expensive to burn gasoline and coal, we’ll do less of it. Attacks on the share prices of companies is the tail wagging the dog.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Political speech is about respect</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/04/06/political-speech-is-about-respect/"/>
   <updated>2014-04-05T20:13:26-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/04/06/political-speech-is-about-respect</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m just working through my thoughts on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/03/us/politics/supreme-court-ruling-on-campaign-contributions.html?hp&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;recent Supreme Court decision to strike down limits on campaign contributions&lt;/a&gt;. My thoughts came together in reaction to a recent ”&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tvladeck/status/452513884394360832&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tweetstorm&lt;/a&gt;” by Marc Andreesen, the famous venture capitalist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His framing of the debate was essentially that we should trust people to make the best voting decisions for themselves regardless of who’s controlling the information flowing through various media&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll let you work through his interpretation if you want; I think his interpretation flattens, and isn’t really representative of, the real debate so I won’t elaborate on it or critique it all here, but I will focus on one thing: his focus on &lt;strong&gt;influence&lt;/strong&gt; as the key point. When I worked through how I thought about the issue, that wasn’t what moved the needle for me. For me, leveling the playing field in political speech is about &lt;strong&gt;respect&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I think about it is this: imagine you’re part of a small community that makes decisions collectively, by a simple vote, with the opportunity for everyone to speak their mind around a table before votes are cast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could it ever be fair to allow the wealthiest among this group to speak for more time than the others? Obviously not. In this sort of gathering, it would be disrespectful, and would never be allowed in the room. This illustrates why political speech (the debate before the vote) &lt;strong&gt;as a whole&lt;/strong&gt; ought to be protected, and we should not allow single groups to utterly dominate the conversation. It’s &lt;strong&gt;disrespectful&lt;/strong&gt; to those who don’t have the means to participate, regardless of whether or not there is any unfair influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously national debates are not the same as boardroom-style conversations. But I believe the argument still holds by the same logic that Warren Buffett uses when thinking about his relationship with other owners of the businesses he invests in, as well as Berkshire Hathaway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many ways, fellow stockholders in a public corporation are a lot like fellow citizens; you don’t know each other, but you have a common interest in the health of the company (or country), and you make decisions through a form of representative democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what’s the best way to think of these anonymous people? As Buffett says, in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/owners.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;“owners manual”&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Although our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership. Charlie Munger and I think of our shareholders as owner-partners, and of ourselves as managing partners. ... We hope you visualize yourself as a part owner of a business that you expect to stay with indefinitely, much as you might if you owned a farm or apartment house in partnership with members of your family.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This “scaling down” of how you think about interacting with anonymous groups of other people is enormously helpful in properly attaching human values to debates about how large, anonymous societies interact with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Why are markets bipolar?</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/03/31/why-are-markets-bipolar/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-31T18:48:01-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/03/31/why-are-markets-bipolar</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I think most people would agree that the stock market is bipolar - i.e. that sometimes it prices stocks way too high, and sometimes it prices stocks way too low. But yet it’s very hard to make more money than the average in the stock market? How can these two seemingly contradictory statements be true?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out that you have to just make a few simple assumptions and you can build a model with these characteristics: i.e. prices that are impossible to beat systematically, but that seem in retrospect to have been very very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is all adopted from Benoit Mandelbrot’s work. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://users.math.yale.edu/mandelbrot/web_pdfs/043nonlinearForecasts.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume we have a company that has a discounted stream of earnings worth $1. Every day, the earnings can go up by $1, stay flat, or decrease by $1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s assume that there is some “momentum” to these earnings movements. For every streak of X days the earnings go up, let’s say that the expected value of the number of future days the earnings will go up is also X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, let’s say this company starts with $1 worth of future earnings, and the next day they have built that up to $2. Earnings may continue to grow, or fall, but &lt;b&gt;the expected value&lt;/b&gt; of future earnings is now $3. This expected value is the &lt;strong&gt;price of the claim on the earnings&lt;/strong&gt;, or in other words, the &lt;strong&gt;price of the stock&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of reasons an increase in earnings would portend a further increase in earnings: the company has more to invest in sales, marketing, or equipment, or could buy back stock (increasing the earnings per share).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is true, we’d then expect &lt;b&gt;prices &lt;/b&gt;for future earnings to rise (and fall!) much faster than the actual earnings streams themselves. What this looks like, in graphical form, is this:
&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screenshot-2014-03-31-15.11.30.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-237&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2014-03-31 15.11.30&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screenshot-2014-03-31-15.11.30-300x208.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;208&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screenshot-2014-03-31-15.11.09.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-238&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2014-03-31 15.11.09&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Screenshot-2014-03-31-15.11.09-300x206.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;206&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
You can see the spreadsheet I used to put this together &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hxJoua0GGo1RLAknaBFRwPZI-1zcTFgCreHSrSA0GI8/edit?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; [there is not much in the way of detailing the math, but if you’re interested, comment below and I’ll walk you through it].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this is &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; a complete model by any stretch. It’s just an illustration of how prices can always be “right” in that they represent the current best guess about the value of a stream of earnings, and then appear wildly wrong a short moment later.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The four types of incertitude</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/03/30/the-four-types-of-incertitude/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-30T15:37:12-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/03/30/the-four-types-of-incertitude</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post was inspired by a recent tweet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/trengriffin/status/450331161324027904&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which reminded me of one of my favorite lessons in grad school at LSE. The lesson is simple: we think about how many different ways there are to have incomplete information about the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very simple way to think about it is to think about foresight is it having two dimensions: knowledge about what the potential outcomes &lt;strong&gt;are&lt;/strong&gt;; and knowledge about how &lt;strong&gt;likely&lt;/strong&gt; each outcome is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pulling a random card from a normal 52-card deck is a great example of perfect knowledge about both what the range of outcomes are and how likely each outcome is. Even though the outcome is uncertain, we have great mathematical tools for figuring out how we should behave in advance of knowing what the outcome ends up being. This is called “risk”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But many situations are not so favorable. Asking a lady out, for example, has a few canonical outcomes (she says no, she says yes, she demurs, etc.), but the asker will in many cases not have a clue what the likelihoods are. This is called “uncertainty” - where you know what the outcomes are, but not the odds of each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that we have the two axes - outcomes and likelihoods - we can define two more “perfect” endpoints on this two dimensional spectrum of incertitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Ambiguity” is where you know what the likelihoods are, but not what the outcomes would be. As a contrived example, consider that you were dealt a hand that you weren’t allowed to look at. You would be dealt one more card that you’d be allowed to see. You’d have perfect knowledge about the likelihood of each card coming up, but, crucially, not how it would affect your hand. This type of incertitude is common in very complex situations where you can’t parse out the impact of any given outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, “ignorance” is where you have knowledge neither of what the outcomes are, or what their likelihoods are. These are the “unknown unknowns” that Donald Rumsfeld made famous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visually, the layout of different situations looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/597_andy_s_fig_2.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-232&quot; alt=&quot;597_andy_s_fig_2&quot; src=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/597_andy_s_fig_2-300x186.gif&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;186&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Different methods for handling the different forms of incertitude are listed in italics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most important thing, though, is to know where you are in this space. If you think you’re in “risk” space, but in reality you’re in “uncertainty”, you’re setting yourself up for a bad day, as the tools you’re using may rely on a probability distribution of outcomes to guide decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my view, the bottom half of this matrix (as presented in the graphic) is significantly more common than the top. It’s very rare that we ever have a real distribution to work with; at least not one that we haven’t simply contrived or guessed at so that we could use friendlier, more comforting mathematical models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, “risk” is actually a very special case in this space, but most of the models you see for decision-making (i.e., the ubiquitous excel spreadsheet) are built around the “risk” case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Another update to &#8220;Conflict&#8221;: Bangladesh</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/03/28/another-update-to-conflict-bangladesh/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-28T12:58:46-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/03/28/another-update-to-conflict-bangladesh</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh worries me. As I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/2014/01/10/climate-change-is-about-conflict/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div data-twttr-id=&quot;twttr-sandbox-0&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world, with 150 million people crammed into an area the size of New York State. It also lies in lowlands, and a 1 meter rise in sea levels would flood about 10% of the land. Clearly, with so many people in such a small area, this would create problems. In addition, many people don’t know that Bangladesh used to be “East Pakistan”, or the eastern of two predominantly Muslim regions of the former British colony, and it shares with modern India (Bangladesh’s neighbor) and Pakistan in their violent history. It’s not hard to imagine a scenario where sea level rises (among other negative climatic changes) cause massive displacements of people in a context that cannot support that other than violently.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/29/world/asia/facing-rising-seas-bangladesh-confronts-the-consequences-of-climate-change.html?hp&amp;amp;_r=0&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;There is a great story today in the New York Times about how climate change is affecting Bangladesh.&lt;/a&gt; Read it and let me know what you think.

   <title>What I&#8217;ve been up to</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/03/09/what-ive-been-up-to/"/>
   <updated>2014-03-09T18:58:32-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/03/09/what-ive-been-up-to</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;February was a crazy travel month. I packed trips to Casablanca, DC, Tahoe, London, and Venice (and not to mention the airports of Chicago, New York, Paris, Brussels, and Frankfurt) into the span of 31 Jan to 2 March.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lately, I’ve been thinking about insurance and risk. It’s funny when things you’ve worked on a while ago and since discarded pop back into your life. Three and a half years ago I wrote &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Thesis.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;my master’s thesis&lt;/a&gt; on the relationship between insurance, climate change, and capital investment. Somewhat randomly I was asked to put together a short paper on this topic for &lt;a href=&quot;http://newclimateeconomy.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;New Climate Economy&lt;/a&gt;, where I am a Senior Programme Officer, where I’ll get the chance to show off some of the ideas that I developed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gist is that since insurance markets clear annually (a little bit longer for some reinsurance contracts), exposure to long-term risks (like climate change), can’t be traded with existing insurance instruments. Weather is a draw from a distribution, whereas climate is the distribution itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in many regions there is an acute risk that premia will rise substantially in the future. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/29/nyregion/cost-of-coastal-living-to-climb-under-new-flood-rules.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;This already happened on the East Coast of the US after Sandy&lt;/a&gt;. But this risk can’t be transferred, since no forward / futures markets exist for insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end there are two reasons this is of concern: First, the lack of a market for this risk means that those holding it can’t dispose of it directly, and may be unequipped to handle it. The premia for, say, windstorm insurance for a residence could rise so substantially that it becomes unaffordable, or that this rise in prices causes a substantial hit to the home equity value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second concern is that a lack of pricing for this risk causes a distorted investment picture, and not only will there be no risk cover for those ultimately affected, but &lt;b&gt;the absence of a signal on future risks causes even more people and property to be exposed to them&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s what I’ve been doing and thinking about. À bientôt!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I posted this yesterday as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7092351&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comment on Hacker News&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;For two years I ran a company called Building Hero (www.buildinghero.com) that marketed and financed LED lighting retrofits to commercial locations in New York City and San Francisco.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Here are a few things to consider when wading into energy efficiency finance:

1. Returns to energy efficiency upgrades accrue out of negative cashflow (money not spent), which means its hard/impossible to put a legal &quot;box&quot; around the financial returns to the project, contra solar investments, where there is a meter and it's usually possible to slice and dice who gets what.

2. Energy efficiency upgrades also pose a problem with respect to collateral. In our case, although we had the right to take back our LED lamps, the value of what we got back, even in the best case, would have been negligible. Most EE upgrades are even less inviting as collateral, like insulation or HVAC upgrades.

3. There are simpler, but more balkanized (i.e., different not only from state to state, but even utility to utility, or city to city) financial incentives for energy efficiency upgrades. This poses a challenge for finance as a differentiator for energy efficiency. Simpler incentives mean the value of a third-party financier who abstracts away these problems is less valuable; and more balkanized incentives mean that is harder in any case for a third-party to offer solutions that scale geographically. Again, contra solar, where the federal tax incentives mean that it’s almost necessary for a third-party with tax equity appetite to finance a portion of the investment, and since it’s at the federal level it scales across the US.

My advice would be to do some careful thinking about how and why your financial offerings are better than what you could do financing them on a credit card or through a normal bank loan.

In addition, I would put some serious thought into whether or not finance is the true barrier for energy efficiency projects. Again unlike solar, these things are inside the home/office/whatever, not outside, so bring up aesthetic concerns as well as comfort concerns. Other things, like HVAC systems, are usually replaced when they break.

&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000;&quot;&gt;Anyway, I hope this is useful and that you get a lot of projects done!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Climate Change is about Conflict</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/01/10/climate-change-is-about-conflict/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-10T11:45:33-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/01/10/climate-change-is-about-conflict</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In various ways during and after college, I’ve worked on climate change. In fact, it’s pretty much the defining issue of my life and career thus far. For a long time, I might have had a hard time explaining exactly why it was that I cared about it. And outside of my professional circle, many people I know have a hard time envisioning exactly what it is about climate change we should care about. Yeah, there are big hurricanes and disasters like Sandy and Katrina, and extreme weather events like cold-waves and heat-waves that seem to be more common these days and that are beginning to impact the day-to-day of people around the world, but overall it’s something that is very hard to observe. But my logic was simpler and more abstract: that humans and our economy evolved on Earth under a broad set of climatic conditions; changing those conditions at our current scale and pace just seemed like a Bad Idea, and would manifest itself in broadly lower living standards around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now, I would characterize my concerns about climate change in one word: War.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not an expert in human conflict, but it appears broadly true that migration and struggles over resources are two of the most important ingredients in catalyzing strife at all scales. If you have trouble thinking of examples where resource conflicts caused human conflict, look no further than the current situations in Darfur and Syria. In both cases, droughts caused shifting resources and displaced peoples, and brought two groups of people into conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Darfur, a long period of low rainfall and advancing desert pushed Arab nomads into land held by black farmers, and the result over time was a major escalation into war, political collapse, and further ecological collapse triggered by conflict that resulted in up to half a million dead and scores of violent atrocities that will scar the region for a generation, and leaves a permanently unstable situation. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/jun/23/sudan.climatechange&quot;&gt;more info&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Syria, a major drought over the years 2004-2011 caused almost a million Syrian farmers to lose their livelihood, and many of them abandoned their land. As much as 85% of all livestock died and major crop failures were common. Displaced farmers moved into cities at massive scale, and these people were at the brink, with no jobs and food shortages common throughout the country. In combination with a corrupt government and ethnic tension, the scene was ripe for conflict, which exploded in 2011 and shows no signs of abating. [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/understanding-syria-from-pre-civil-war-to-post-assad/281989/&quot;&gt;more info&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, exacerbating factors were present, and it would be foolish to say that climate change was the only factor behind the conflict. Rather, it was one of many ingredients, amid sectarian and racial tensions, corrupt or failed states, and poverty, that sparked the conflict, and indeed it’s because these conflicts are so complicated that they have been difficult to untangle and end. But the connection is clear: changes in local climates caused resource shifts and movements of people that, under the right (or, rather, wrong) conditions, led to major conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, droughts began a fairly straightforward, and short, sequence of events that led to conflict. But it doesn’t matter how long and complex the chain is, if climate changes cause something that causes something that causes something, and so on, that causes something that causes conflict, the changes to the climate are still culpable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the things that really scare me about climate change are things that won’t necessarily appear to be caused by the climate, like the two examples listed above, along with broadly lower living conditions, but quite unlike news-grabbing events like the Polar Vortex, Sandy, Katrina, the 2013 European Heat Wave, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fear that changing, and in many cases deteriorating, conditions will be manifested, and punctuated, by human conflict at scales ranging from minor to massive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll conclude with a development that I consider to be evolving into situation with violent potential: potentially massive Bangladeshi migration caused by sea level rise. But as I quoted recently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;https://twitter.com/tvladeck/status/421040752655753216&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So perhaps what scares me most are the situations that we haven’t yet envisioned. All we need to know is that we’re adding more of the wrong ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh is the most densely populated country in the world, with 150 million people crammed into an area the size of New York State. It also lies in lowlands, and a 1 meter rise in sea levels would flood about 10% of the land. Clearly, with so many people in such a small area, this would create problems. In addition, many people don’t know that Bangladesh used to be “East Pakistan”, or the eastern of two predominantly Muslim regions of the former British colony, and it shares with modern India (Bangladesh’s neighbor) and Pakistan in their violent history. It’s not hard to imagine a scenario where sea level rises (among other negative climatic changes) cause massive displacements of people in a context that cannot support that other than violently.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>How to write</title>

   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2014/01/07/how-to-write</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Could have used this before writing 16 business school essays:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;As for how to write well, here's the short version: Write a bad version 1 as fast as you can; rewrite it over and over; cut &lt;s&gt;out &lt;/s&gt;everything unnecessary; write in a conversational tone; develop a nose for bad writing, so you can see and fix it in yours; imitate writers you like; if you can't get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said; expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong; be confident enough to cut; have friends you trust read your stuff and tell you which bits are confusing or drag; don't (always) make detailed outlines; mull ideas over for a few days before writing; carry a small notebook or scrap paper with you; start writing when you think of the first sentence; if a deadline forces you to start before that, just say the most important sentence first; write about stuff you like; don't try to sound impressive; don't hesitate to change the topic on the fly; use footnotes to contain digressions; use anaphora to knit sentences together; read your essays out loud to see (a) where you stumble over awkward phrases and (b) which bits are boring (the paragraphs you dread reading); try to tell the reader something new and useful; work in fairly big quanta of time; when you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far; when you finish, leave yourself something easy to start with; accumulate notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file; don't feel obliged to cover any of them; write for a reader who won't read the essay as carefully as you do, just as pop songs are designed to sound ok on crappy car radios; if you say anything mistaken, fix it immediately; ask friends which sentence you'll regret most; go back and tone down harsh remarks; publish stuff online, because an audience makes you write more, and thus generate more ideas; print out drafts instead of just looking at them on the screen; use simple, germanic words; learn to distinguish surprises from digressions; learn to recognize the approach of an ending, and when one appears, grab it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>Nouns are not necessarily agents</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/12/27/nouns-are-not-necessarily-agents/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-27T14:08:52-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/12/27/nouns-are-not-necessarily-agents</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It’s not uncommon to see statements like “Wall Street needs to give this company a break” or “Silicon Valley should fund more cleantech firms”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These statements, in some sense, make perfect sense. They are shorthand for, respectively, “investors in this company need to be more patient with it”, and “partners in venture capital funds based in Silicon Valley should fund more cleantech firms”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they are nonsensical in another interpretation. Because both are nouns, they can be the subjects of a sentence, so they are the “something” undergoing or causing an action - a verb. But grammar makes no distinction between those verbs that require agenthood or not, so they can be used in a seemingly meaningful way in sentences that could never be realized and have questionable meaning, like “the painting should [decide to] walk across the floor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So these sentences can look, and be interpreted as, phrases that are not shorthand. The twisted interpretation is that an abstract concept or representation can “decide to” do something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both the named cases, Wall Street and Silicon Valley, are representations of collections of things, but the relationship between the representation and its constituents is not symmetric. The constituents of each (the VC, or the Mutual Fund, for example) are agents of the representation, but not vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The long story short is that this confusion causes a lot of sloppy thinking, and leads people to go down “garden alleys” of logic that assume that a group can coordinate its actions or otherwise be treated as a decision-making unit. Much (if not most) of the time, they can’t, and statements or arguments that contain that implicit assumption are flawed from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Language and Discrimination</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/12/22/language-and-discrimination/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-22T12:51:47-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/12/22/language-and-discrimination</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading &lt;i&gt;The Language Instinct&lt;/i&gt; by Steven Pinker. Amazing book. Among a lot of reactions to the book, I had a thought about language and discrimination. It proceeds along the following lines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, humans evolved in small communities. So it’s natural to assume that at first glance we perceive a lack of intelligible language as an indicator of poor intelligence or something “wrong”, since the small groups we evolved in would not be multilingual, so they would have no &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; reason to expect anything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But all normal humans have language that is equally expressive and sophisticated, since language is literally “invented” de novo by each generation with the existing language around them as mere ingredients into their invention. Ostracized or marginal groups won’t share the same inputs, and so will invent a different language. For instance, &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;African American Vernacular English&lt;/span&gt; is just as “sophisticated” as Standard American English, it’s just different. But for whatever reason it has been natural to perceive it as a failure to be able to speak “correct” English and so to assign those speakers a lower intelligence / ability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Languages change so rapidly that it only takes one generation to start speaking differently. So if a group gets marginalized, they will speak a new language almost instantly by historical standards, and then the fact that the speak differently will be a wedge between them and other groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The book also got me thinking about how we teach language and our respect for different dialects. It seems that curricula should explicitly say, for example, that AAVE and Standard English are different languages, rather than put down AAVE as corrupted Standard English. I remember that in my junior high and high school, which were both over 50% Black, that AAVE was not appropriately respected in this manner. This changes the dynamic from “’He be walkin’ is wrong” to “‘He be walkin’ is right but in a different language, and not correct in Standard English”. It’s a more complicated conversation but more correct.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Vladeck is a nom de guerre</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/12/13/vladeck-is-a-nom-de-guerre/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-13T00:24:05-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/12/13/vladeck-is-a-nom-de-guerre</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I posted this on facebook, but I wanted to make sure it existed somewhere else too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I included a few facts about my great-grandfather in a business-school admissions essay, and got something wrong. My father, reviewing it, supplies some facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few facts about grandpa that are hard to find on the internet. One is that he used the name “Vladeck” in Russia as his revolutionary name to protect his family during the 1905 Revolution, which was unsuccessful. Vladeck was his nom de guerre. When he came to the US and wanted a public life, Russian and Jewish immigrants knew him as Vladeck, and so he took that name formally when he arrived in the US. I think you can say that we believe that the name is unique and that anyone with the same last name is a direct descendant of grandpa. Two, as I understand it, more than 1/2 million people lined the streets to watch, not “follow,” his funeral process. I am not sure that the turnout has ever been equaled in NY. Third, during the La Guardia administration, grandpa was actually the majority leader of the city council because the Socialists (the American Labor Party) caucused with the Democrats to give them a majority, and one concession the ALP got from the Dems was that grandpa would be the majority leader. At grandpa’s funeral, Gov. Herbert Lehman, Sen. Robert Wagner, Socialist leader Norman Thomas and of course Mayor La Guardia spoke, as did many, many others. My grandmother, who was a sourpuss, complained bitterly that the funeral service went on way too long. Fourth, the Vladeck houses were named after grandpa because he fought to create the NY Public Housing Authority; his brother Bill was actually the architect for the project. Grandpa believed that the city had to get people out of the overcroweded, disease-ridden teniments they crowded into and that public housing would be a vital public service. He died before they were built and they were named after him for his leadership on the issue. This was the first housing project built by the New York City Housing Authority. Finally, grandpa is probably better known for his role in the Jewish Daily Forward, which at the time the largest non-English language publication in the US, with a huge circulation. During his tenure the average daily circulation was over a 1/4 of a million. He was active too in Jewish affairs, forming the American Jewish Congress in the early 1930s and trying to persuade companies early on to boycott German goods.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>why i believe in god</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/12/05/why-i-believe-in-god/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-05T14:42:37-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/12/05/why-i-believe-in-god</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;i wanted to write this while listening to the blind watchmaker by richard dawkins. it might seem strange that i will use richard dawkins in the following argument, given that he is a prominent atheist. but i don’t think that there would be much disagreement between us, since the god i believe in is very much a different thing than the god he denounces. my god is this: something beyond our universe that gave rise to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;dawkins, in the blind watchmaker, gives a great theory of complexity: those things that have a configuration that is staggeringly unlikely to have arisen by chance, things like people and cars relative to mountains and moons. he also gives a great inductive proof of darwinian evolution, showing the mechanism and how easily it could have arisen. i believe these two arguments are fantastic analogs for why i believe in god.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;first, the complexity concept. dawkins eloquently divides the universe into things that could have come about by chance, and things that could not have come about by chance. humans, cars, etc. fall into the latter category, because their working configurations are so improbable. therefore, some non-random force must have given rise to it. in the case of all life, this force is darwinism. i am convinced by this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but i would also argue that the universe itself is one of these complex things. the physical forces that govern the universe are utterly improbable in both their quantitative and qualitative configurations. the only conclusions are that it was designed to be so, or that there are many universes — perhaps infinitely many — and since we exist in this one, of course we observe forces that are consistent with our own existence. but either way, i believe we have arrived at god: either the force that designed our universe, our the medium in which many universes exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;second, we foray into induction. dawkins’ proof of evolution is at heart an inductive proof: he convincingly shows why we would expect the mechanism to work, that it does work, and that it has worked. natural selection is essentially the inductive step — how we travel between generations. but for this to work you also have to be able to prove an initial condition. in darwinism’s case, this is easy enough. the conditions for the first replicating chemicals — life — were simple enough (in dawkins’ sense — sufficiently probable to have occurred on its own).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but this is not true for the universe as a whole. yes, we have the tools for the inductive steps: we can explain through physical laws — both known and as-yet undiscovered — why we observe what we observe, and how the universe has evolved since the big bang. but we cannot simply “grant” the initial condition. we know that the big bang happened, but we cannot explain how or why, and we have no context to say whether or not it was probable or improbable. in fact, words fail to describe it not happening, or “before” it happening (before is a word relating to the temporal dimension, which only came into existence at the big bang), or what was “outside” (outside refers to being in or out of a 3-or-less-dimensional subspace, something that also only came into existence at the big bang) the universe when it came into existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the big bang happened, and we’ll never know why. and the laws imbued in our universe have made it beautiful, and made the mathematical laws that gave rise to darwinism, which gave rise to us; all beautiful. that’s evidence enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Being your own customer</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/11/19/being-your-own-customer/"/>
   <updated>2013-11-19T13:56:52-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/11/19/being-your-own-customer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recently I’ve been idly thinking about companies that have the good fortune of being their own customer. I think this is an extremely valuable place to be, because it gives you the best possible insight into your product, and insulates you from losing touch with your product’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some examples I think of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Salesforce's use of their own CRM product with a team of salespeople that sell their product. Not only do they get great feedback on their own product, but the fact that they have a best-in-breed sales team is great marketing itself, and they get to be a thought leader in their space.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;I bet Dropbox and Box use their own file-sharing services internally. By doing this, they get great insight into how a corporate might use their product and what features they'd need. Same with Evernote and Google Apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wonder though, if this is possible only for B2B (or even more narrowly, enterprise) products. Can consumer-product companies be their own customers. Of course their employees can; but is that enough?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Kenneth Arrow, Geometry, and Political Parties</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/11/16/kenneth-arrow-geometry-and-political-parties/"/>
   <updated>2013-11-16T11:53:09-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/11/16/kenneth-arrow-geometry-and-political-parties</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My college friends and I often engage in email conversations spanning 50+ messages about some sophisticated topic. Recently, we discussed politics and political parties: whether or not the participants identify with a party, why or why not, the two party system, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’d been testing out a theory in my head for why political parties exist, and this conversation made me recall it. The reasoning is logical and geometric, and the result is essentially a defense of the two party system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We start with the observation that there are a lot of things people care about: health care, national security, taxes, guns, abortion — to name just a few high profile issues. The challenge, then, is to make the decisions of the state that align in some “best” way with the preferences of the citizenry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, sadly, we know that there is no “best” way to do this: every voting method is unfair in some way. This is the result that won Kenneth Arrow his Nobel Prize. But this isn’t the only interesting way this theory applies: so far we’ve only applied it directly to people — it works the same way when applied to parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if there’s no way to directly vote in such a way that expresses society’s wishes, let’s examine how we might get close. As noted above, we have some high-dimensional “issue space” and we might parameterize this space with some distance function that expresses how “close” two positions are, which could be something like “how willing someone with position A would be to tolerate voting for a candidate of position B”. “Wants to require stricter background checks” is probably quite close to “wants to ban assault rifles”, and so on. Every voter is somewhere on this position space — or more accurately, every voter occupies a subspace of this issue space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue space is HUGE; for example, ten issues each with three possible positions (a vast oversimplification of course) is 3^10 possible combinations, or about 60,000. Twenty issues with ten possible positions is over 10 trillion combinations. Far too vast for any person’s ability to comprehend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What political parties do is engage in natural competition to find the best real estate to build their platform. So the function that political parties perform, seen in this light, is quite natural and obviously extremely valuable. They solve an enormous complexity problem by collapsing the issue/decision space from an incomprehensibly large space to something tractable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’re now in a situation where we’re voting for large swaths of the issue space instead of specific positions in it. That’s what political parties did for us. But Arrow’s theorem tells us that any time there are three or more distinct choices, voting systems are inherently flawed. This is why two parties make sense. Between two choices (and no more than that), a vote can be fair. And how do we get down to only two choices? Political parties.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Intergenerational discount rates</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/10/22/intergenerational-discount-rates/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-22T15:27:06-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/10/22/intergenerational-discount-rates</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’ve been idly wondering about how philanthropic behavior and the saving patterns of parents should influence our understanding of intergenerational discount rates. It seems that when people do selfless things for their progeny, or simply for posterity, they are exhibiting very low to zero intergenerational discount rates; at the very least it seems to complicate the transition between investment preferences within an agent’s life and those across human generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why have I been thinking this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These days I’m working on a project that’s being billed internally as a follow up to the highly influential &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern_Review&quot;&gt;Stern Report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, which was commissioned by the UK government and published in 2006. In a nutshell, the &lt;i&gt;Stern Report&lt;/i&gt; attempted to understand the scale of climate change as a market failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although our understanding of the science is always evolving, climate change is often understood as a problem that has causes today, and effects later on. There is thus the immediate challenge of comparing temporal apples and oranges - how do you compare the benefits of the causes with the damages of the effects if they don’t happen at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For economists and most social scientists, the answer is &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertemporal_choice&quot;&gt;discount rates&lt;/a&gt;. Conceptually, discount rates “discount” the future - i.e., between $1 today and $1 in a year, we’ll value the $1 today higher than the $1 in the future - for a variety of reasons: the future is uncertain, for example, we may never get that $1; there are productive investments available - if you give me a $1 today there is a good chance I can turn that into more than a dollar by investing it; and other reasons as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question - the $1,000,000 question - is what the discount rate should be. A very low discount rate values the future almost as highly as the present. A high discount rate amplifies the present significantly - future payoffs or costs will barely register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application to an economic understanding of climate change should be immediately obvious. If the causes (the production of goods and services - good things) are today, and the effects (destructive weather and climatic effects - bad things) are tomorrow, the choice of a discount rate will &lt;b&gt;completely determine&lt;/b&gt; whether or not we should adjust our path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest critiques of &lt;i&gt;Stern Report&lt;/i&gt; were that they chose a very low discount rate. They had good reasons, but many economists essentially pointed out that they were &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question&quot;&gt;begging the question&lt;/a&gt;. Yes - with a low discount rate, Climate Change is Bad. Their contribution was essentially to estimate the scale of the market failure at their very low discount rate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, my own thoughts have been changing rapidly. I used to be on the carbon price everywhere train - but it appears that this is not politically feasible. Carbon price&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; may be possible - i.e. through things like gas taxes or permitting fees that effectively collapse to an economy-wide price on carbon. But personally, I’m now turning towards technological progress as the only feasible source of solutions to GHG emissions. That has different policy implications that I’m only beginning to grasp beyond “let’s spend a lot of money figuring it out”.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Experiential Companies</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/10/16/experiential-companies/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-16T02:11:12-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/10/16/experiential-companies</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post was prompted by a recent article about design at Google in &lt;i&gt;Fast Company&lt;/i&gt;. Apparently, prior to Larry Page becoming CEO, there was real fragmentation in Google’s design across its various products. When Page took the helm, he made unifying the design vocabulary, in order to provide a consistent experience, a major priority. The goal was to become an “experiential” company, like Apple - one whose relationship with customers transcended isolated uses of their products and interfaced with whole swaths of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Experiential companies are a category beyond “product” companies. Rather than being oriented around a particular “job” in a customer’s life, they are oriented around many categories of the customer’s life, and build linkages between their products to make it easier for the customer to bring the company with them (i.e. to continue to use the company’s products) when they change contexts in their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, a powerful “linkage” between products is to have a common user interface or user-facing design vocabulary - if you know how to use one product, you know how to use another - making it massively easier to adopt new products from the same company. Sharing data between products, or providing native interactions between them, also strengthen the relationship. A company’s products become a network in and of themselves with all the attendant competitive benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To qualify, the company needs to have clearly different products - not just different features or offshoots of the core product. Otherwise you’re not breaking into new customer contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a note, I’m mainly thinking of consumer-facing companies, not enterprise companies - but if you think creatively it’s possible to view these thoughts applying to the latter, and indeed I’m sure there are enterprise-facing firms that would fit this bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple is the quintessential “experiential” company, but I would argue that this aspect of it is in decline. You don’t just use Apple products, you experience “Apple”. Apple has come to define so much of our lives because their many products serve different jobs in our lives - to play music and movies, surf the web, make calls, etc. Apple’s products are great in isolation, but the linkages helped fuel their expansion. Your iPod connected to the iTunes store on your Macbook, which was backed up by your Time Capsule, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over time, Apple’s products are losing their relationship with each other. You use your iPhone, but its relationship to your Macbook Air is becoming more tenuous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google is becoming, I think, the most pre-eminent experiential company. There are extremely strong linkages across their products, and they capture our interest in so many different contexts of our lives - pretty much whenever we use the Internet, for whatever purpose. Send an important email? Watch a funny video? Get car directions? How about get a funny video sent over gchat right after you send that important email - you can watch it right there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, on the other hand, is a poor example of this. It’s hard to see how Flickr and Tumblr (admitted only recently acquired) mesh together or how Delicious did when it was alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bar is high. There aren’t that many companies that can (a) make &lt;b&gt;multiple&lt;/b&gt; successful products and (b) create deep linkages between them.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Twitter #conversation</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/10/04/twitter-conversation/"/>
   <updated>2013-10-04T18:03:34-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/10/04/twitter-conversation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;A comments platform powered by Twitter.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is everywhere on the web. Twitter cards and other features allow Tweets to get distributed off of Twitter’s properties into other websites, where they can be interacted-with. I propose that Twitter develop a simple comments platform, based on Twitter’s existing functionality, that could be integrated into any website desiring a comments feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goals:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Engagement - this product would allow Twitter users to discover interesting conversations about content they are interested in (indeed - are in the process of consuming) while they are not on Twitter’s main feed. In addition, it would enable content providers to capture and display conversations happening on Twitter about their content on their own property (while still in a feed controlled by Twitter).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Acquisition - web users consuming content will be exposed to Twitter in a new channel and invited to participate in a novel way.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Revenue - this feature would provide more Tweet impressions and would also expose a new set of “timelines” with which to integrate native ads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functionality&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;List of Comments. User avatars and handles listed along with comments.
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Comments will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be displayed chronologically.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They will be displayed by a custom ranking having to do with activity and influence, designed to surface the most interesting conversations going on about the content&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Before a comment is made, the user is asked to sign in. If the user is signed in on the browser they will comment with that account&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Before a comment is made, the user will have the option of replying to a user or not.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When a comment is made, it is published both as a Tweet (which goes into Twitter’s “main feed”) and as a Comment (which stays on the site).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;When making a Comment, the user will not be restricted to any character limit (or the character limit will be longer than 140 characters, at some length appropriate to a comment). If the length of the comment/Tweet, with the appropriate handles, is longer than 140 characters, the Tweet version of the Comment will be automatically shortened and will include a link to the larger Comment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tweets made outside Twitter #conversation that fit any of the following criteria will also be displayed in the comments section on the web property
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;include the link to the page, or&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;are a reply to
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a Tweet with a link to the page, or&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;a Tweet originating from a Comment on that page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There are at least two and potentially three “views” to consider for this content:
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the comments section on the web property using Twitter #conversation&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Twitter’s “main feed”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The “conversation” view for Tweets that are replies to each other&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Ads could be displayed in the feed of Comments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Private investment, inequality, and democracy</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/09/30/private-investment-inequality-and-democracy/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-30T00:23:19-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/09/30/private-investment-inequality-and-democracy</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the things I have loved about thinking about new products is the alignment between creating value with the product and doing good for society. People buy what you’re selling because it’s making their lives better. The more you sell, the better you’re doing for society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a very unequal society, there is substantial money to be made in serving the interests of the wealthiest segment of society. Here it’s possible for the virtuous link between investment in new products and social good to be broken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since new products shape our society so powerfully, and implicitly promote certain sets of values, can we really treat private investments into new products as a purely private matter? Or is the cycle of product innovation basically exogenous and we have to treat it as-is?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Product management is a dark art</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/09/26/product-management-is-a-dark-art/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-26T19:59:29-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/09/26/product-management-is-a-dark-art</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;At least according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/tywhite&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ty White&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My primary career objective is to conceive and commercialize new products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, post &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.buildinghero.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;startup&lt;/a&gt;, I’m looking to work in product management. I love the cross functional role and the fact that you’re responsible for delivering (I like having the ball).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been speaking with as many product managers as possible. Through my conversations with people in that role I now believe the title is a pretty accurate statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Bitter, Georgia, serif; font-size: 22px; line-height: 1.3;&quot;&gt;It's an art, not a science&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way that Angelist became a huge success and is reshaping the startup funding space is very different from, for example, how Tesla got its start. Angelist started out as an email-only product that served a community and kept adding features. It’s very easy to see how Angelist followed a “lean” model of product development. It’s very hard to see how Tesla followed any development model other than simply imagining, and then building, the future. Both are successes. So what’s the lesson?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To borrow a phrase from Warren Buffett, it seems that &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/924827-some-of-the-weirdest-batting-stances-in-major-league-baseball-history&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;every product management team has their own “batting stance”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;It's dark (as in obscure)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Product managers don’t have as much of a community - either online or offline - as other product development and corporate functions. From the outside, it’s harder to see exactly what a PM does. (And it definitely means different things in different companies).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engineers have Github, designers have Behance and Dribbble - what do PMs have to show off new product concepts? If you know the answer, please post it as a response to t&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/Product-Management/Is-there-a-place-for-product-managers-to-showcase-new-product-concepts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;his Quora question.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll note: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quirky.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Quirky&lt;/a&gt; is pretty cool for physical products. But it’s less about showcasing your skill than it is about actually developing a product with a community input. And at the risk of entering a meta-cycle, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scott.a16z.com/2012/09/06/disrupting-proctor-gamble/&quot;&gt;Quirky’s main goal is to upend the product development cycle at large consumer brands like Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Help me (and others)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even arts can have well-understood processes and paradigms. In software development, some programmers might use Java and take an object-oriented approach while others might use Clojure and use a functional approach, or use Go and write procedural code. Between those three, and others, there’s no “right” or “wrong” but there are paradigms that other developers understand. Although I don’t know design nearly as well, I’m sure there are similar paradigms that define different approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon, for instance, has a fairly standard PM approach &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quora.com/What-is-Amazons-approach-to-product-development-and-product-management&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;outlined here&lt;/a&gt;. This seems to be a great process. Is it an instance of a particular PM paradigm? If so, what are the other paradigms that PMs understand?&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Shutting Down Building Hero</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/09/13/shutting-down-building-hero/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-13T19:48:42-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/09/13/shutting-down-building-hero</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Or, the difference between Solar and Energy Efficiency Business Models&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;As sustainability buffs, it’s been hard not to notice the success of new solar business models in the US. Numerous large companies, like SolarCity, SunRun, SunEdison, Sungevity, Clean Power Finance - and others - have been formed to deliver solar energy in innovative ways. Third party financing is a central component, and has been huge to solar’s success in the US. In 2012, over 75% of California’s new solar systems were leased as opposed to owned outright [1].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We thought of this business model as Solar-as-a-Service; not only is there third-party financing, but maintenance and equipment replacement are also transferred from the homeowner to the solar distributor. It’s a powerful model because it “transforms a complex investment into a money-saving service” [1]. Boom. That’s an easy decision to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Our premise for Building Hero was that Energy Efficiency as a Service (EE-aaS) could be an even bigger opportunity. It was an easy idea to articulate: “SolarCity for Energy Efficiency”. As energy efficiency nerds and idea guys, we loved the concept and viewed it as a “no brainer” - no money down and energy savings from Day 1? How could customers possibly say no? All of our energy efficiency nerd friends agreed that it was an awesome idea and we were off to the races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Predictably, with an approach like that, most of our target customers did in fact say no. Although we had some minor success with the model, we never attained product-market fit with our approach. Unfortunately, the reasons that Solar-aaS succeeds didn’t hold true as we dug deeper into the EE-aaS model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;We learned a ton of lessons along the way that are particular to the difficult to solve problem of EE-aaS that we wanted to share as future entrepreneurs approach this tough problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Want to chat? We’d be happy to. Feel free to email us geoffplewis [at] gmail or thomas [dot] vladeck [at] gmail&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Inside v. Outside&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The most important operational difference between Solar and EE that we encountered is what we dub “the inside v. outside problem”. Solar devices are “standalone” - not only are they on the outside of the building, but they are entirely new systems that are added to the building. They are not replacing anything. They are also invisible from the inside (where decision makers spend their day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Considering adding something new is a different type of decision than considering replacing something you have with something different. Not only is the customer considering what they are getting, but they also must consider (and often dwell on) what they are losing. Making a core change to the aesthetic or functioning of the space is a more difficult decision to make, and that was a difficult barrier for us to overcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many of our customers, the idea of having work done inside their space, no matter the benefits, immediately put a stop to the whole process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Relative Advantage of Financing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Many energy efficiency investments produce better returns with less required financial engineering to make sense. So it follows that they should be better investments and even more financeable - right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The mistake here is that - at least with LED lighting - financing has a lesser relative advantage over purchasing cf. solar. Solar investments have two features that make financing very valuable:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;High capital cost relative to the assets of the decision maker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Complicated or inaccessible incentives that are required for the investment to make sense - tax credits chief among them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;For LED lighting, the capital costs relative to the assets of the decision-maker are smaller. In addition, in the case of LED lighting, the investment can be done in stages, lowering the capital burden at any given time (something our would-be customers often proposed doing - and many have done).  Second, incentives are often not required for the investment to make sense, and they are usually made available as lump-sum cash rebates as opposed to tax credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;The result is that the delta between investments in LED lighting (and we think this is a problem general to the energy efficiency space) that make sense without financing, and those that make sense only with financing, is much smaller than it is in solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Note that we are not mentioning the problems with energy efficiency investments from the perspective of the financier, namely the “negative cash flow” problem (returns come from money not spent) and the suitability of the physical investment as collateral. These have been discussed at length elsewhere, and frankly were not a factor in the success of our business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Residential v. Commercial&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency investments, by definition, only address part of the overall load in the building. Solar, on the other hand, is often net metered, meaning that the value of the investment is only loosely coupled with the existing energy consumption in the building. And even if the system is not net-metered, it can offset the entire building load as opposed to just the system being replaced. In residences, since people are typically out of the house during the day, many systems simply don’t get enough use to warrant an investment in more efficient equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Energy efficiency investments in residences still often make sense! But take lighting, for example: lights in homes are often only on for a few hours a day. Lights in a retail store may be on for 12 hours or more every day. In a warehouse, it may be all day, every day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is that energy efficiency investments make relatively more sense in commercial spaces than residences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Residences and commercial buildings are very different from a business perspective: occupancy patterns, decision making, internal capabilities, buying patterns, etc., are all very different between the two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Decision-making and Ingrained Buying Patterns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solar is not only a “standalone” system that is an addition to the building, not a replacement of a system - it’s also a completely new product for most decision makers. For existing products, like lighting (or HVAC systems, or windows, etc.), a new business must disrupt existing vendor relationships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In lighting, the barrier is especially strong. Until now, with LEDs, lighting has been a relatively “fast-moving” good. Especially in retail spaces, which use halogen lamps, lighting purchases are frequent. This has led to strong relationships between our targeted customers and their existing distributors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of our customers “had a guy” that did their lighting. For this segment, the option of considering a new relationship for that portion of their space was dismissed off-the-bat. Many of these distributors offer LED lighting, but:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;None of them offer financing (so far as we know!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;LED lighting options are not “what they know”, and it is much easier to keep selling the same products that have been sold for the last thirty years; and finally,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Distributors rely on frequent ongoing business from their relationships. Once a distributor sells their contact LED lights, they will most likely not hear from that contact for a number of years. So there is an incentive not to sell LED lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;From our perspective, the problem was simply that the customers wouldn’t consider our alternative. From a policy or market-structure perspective, there is the further problem that decision makers are not seeing all the available options that may convince them to switch to LEDs. In some cases not even knowing about all the LED options, and in nearly all cases not considering financing options for an investment in LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We both strongly believe that there are better business models out there for energy efficiency than those that exist today. We caution, though, to look beyond financing. Building energy efficiency is a huge resource and we encourage other entrepreneurs to continue attacking this market with new technologies and business models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of us are happy to speak further with anyone that would like to hear more about our experiences. Our emails are geoffplewis [at] gmail [dot] com and thomas [dot] vladeck [at] gmail [dot] com.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;A less impractical many-event conditional prediction market&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is a prediction market?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prediction market is a market where there is a binary payoff based on whether or not an event occurs or not. Take, for example, an election: you might place a bet that a democrat wins the next presidential election. If you win, you get a dollar. If you lose, you get nothing. What would you pay today to buy that payoff?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prediction market is a clearinghouse for these types of securities. The most famous was Intrade, which is now defunct. Someone who thought the probability of Obama winning the election was 70% could buy that a security that would pay a dollar if Obama won from another person who thought the probability was only 50%. The buyer might pay the seller $0.60 for a $1.00 payoff if Obama won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What is a conditional prediction market?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so hopefully this is relatively clear in the case of one event either happening or not (i.e., a democrat winning the next presidential election). What about, though, if you could specify conditions that activated the bet? i.e., something like “a democrat will win the next election if the unemployment rate is less than 8%”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you might guess, this is significantly more complicated. You might have noticed, though, that the equations above did not depend on the length of q (the vector of events in question). In this case, if you had a market with four events:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A: Democrat wins AND unemployment rate less than 8%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;B: Democrat wins AND NOT unemployment rate less than 8%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;C: Democrat loses AND unemployment rate less than 8%&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;D: Democrat loses AND NOT unemployment rate less than 8%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could transact the bet above by having the trader simultaneously buy A and sell C. You can work out the math, but it works out that the amount the trader is “paying” for A and is “receiving” for C are the same, so there is no money transacted. If the unemployment rate is greater than 8%, the trader will lose on A and win on C (regardless of what happens in the election), so in effect the trade won’t have happened: the trader won’t have paid anything, and won’t have received anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if the unemployment rate is less than 8%, the trader must either win or lose. If the trader wins on A, she’ll lose on C, and vice versa. So the bet only becomes “live” if the condition is satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing you probably noticed: even though we have two binary events, now the market is having to keep track of four atomic events. This is a central challenge of conditional prediction markets: with N independent binary events, the number of atomic events you have to track is 2^N - it rises exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This creates two problems: the first is that with so many events, the probability that there will be a counterparty for any one of the many things you want to trade is very low; second, as you add more and more events, there becomes huge computational overhead to tracking the atomic events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first problem is solved by having a market maker ready to price any trade and accept the trade at that price - no other counterparty required. The second is more tricky, and I’ll get to that in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Market scoring rules&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An automated prediction market is a step up in sophistication. In most prediction markets - Intrade was an example - the buyer and seller are people and the clearinghouse is taking no part of the trade. It’s just listing the available trades. In an automated prediction market, the clearinghouse is the counterparty to&lt;b&gt; all&lt;/b&gt; trades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, the clearinghouse has to keep track of what the prices are for each security. To do this, it will use a &lt;b&gt;market scoring rule&lt;/b&gt; that keeps track of all the securities for sale, and updates them as orders get served. As securities get bought, the price goes up, and as they get sold, the price goes down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common form of market scoring rule (common in the sense of appearing in academic journals - there aren’t that many of these prediction markets “in the wild”) is the &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://hanson.gmu.edu/mktscore.pdf&quot;&gt;logarithmic market scoring rule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; created by Robin Hanson. The rule is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C = beta * ln(sum (exp(q_i / beta)))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry that’s hard to read. C is the total amount of money that the clearinghouse has taken from market participants, q is the vector of all bets placed on each event. As you change the vector q, by buying or selling an event, you change C. The amount by which you change C is the price the clearinghouse charges the trader. Beta is a constant which defines the liquidity of the market. The higher the beta, the more liquid the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to find the current price of a given event q_j, you just take the derivative of this cost function with respect to the event in the vector q. That is given by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P(q_j) = exp(q_j/beta) / sum(exp(q_i/beta))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we’re summing over all q_i in q.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you’re asking, what if everyone only buys the event that ends up happening? Won’t the market lose money? The answer, of course, is yes. This market will pretty much always lose money as more people buy the more probable event. But as more people buy a given event, the price goes up - lessening the amount the market-maker loses on that trade. If the first person buys the winning event for $0.50, the market-maker loses $0.50 on a $1.00 payout. But when the second person buys the same event for $0.60, the market-maker will only lose $0.40, and so on. If the price escalates more slowly (i.e., the market is more liquid), the market-maker will lose more; if the price escalates more quickly (i.e., if the second buyer had to pay, say $0.95 for a $1.00 payoff), the market-maker will lose less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total amount the market-maker can lose is this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;beta * ln(length(q))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, in plain english: the liquidity parameter times the log of the number of atomic events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that’s interesting: the loss is bounded. What if you charged a fee for each trade, so that, given a sufficient volume, you could guarantee that you made covered your total loss. Theoretically, you can. We’ll explore that in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The ambition&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall ambition of this project is to create an automated conditional market with a large number of binary events. Imagine trades of the form “the average price of gas on November 1 will be above $4.50 nationally if WTI oil is above $XX a barrel and weather is unseasonably warm in October”. Or, whatever you like. And having a price for that security and a counterparty ready to trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, we want &lt;b&gt;a lot&lt;/b&gt; of binary events. And we want the market to not lose money but also to not charge such a huge bid/ask spread so as to discourage trading. And we want the market to actually function, computationally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This won’t be easy. First, let’s talk about liquidity senstive automated market makers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Liquidity Sensitive Automated Market Makers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of this is taken from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/liquidity-sensitive%20market%20maker.EC10.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So remember that the more liquid the market is, the more the market-maker can potentially lose. What if you adjusted the liquidity as the market progressed so the more trades that take place, the more liquid the market is. Turns out, that’s possible. To do that, we introduce a new concept: alpha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So instead of having beta - the liquidity paramater above - be a constant, we define beta to be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;beta = alpha * sum(q)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, alpha times the total number of trades placed. So as more trades get placed, the market becomes more liquid. It has some tradeoffs, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first tradeoff is that prices will now no longer sum to 1. In the other equations I’ve showed you, it’s obvious that the price of all the events summed together made 1, which make sense probabilistically. Now, the prices sum to slightly over 1 - so the market is “overcharging” for securities in general. The total amount prices may go above one is given by:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;alpha * (2^N) * log(2^N)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other tradeoff is that initially, the liquidity in the market is zero (because nothing has been bought or sold). So the market maker has to “seed” the market by purchasing its own securities so that there will be some liquidity when the market starts. It turns out that, in this liquidity-sensitive market, the dollar amount the market “spends” initially on its own securities (to seed the market with liquidity) is also the total amount the market may lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the real tradeoff is between the initial liquidity and the maximum loss of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The scaling problems of Automated prediction markets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have a number of constraints that we need to consider in our design:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The length of q - the vector of bets placed on each “atomic” event rises exponentially in N (the number of binary events we want to cover). This makes computation intractable for large N.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The maximum loss of the market-maker rises linearly with the amount of initial liquidity in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For any given alpha parameter, the “irrationality” (the amount above 1 they may rise) of the prices rises exponentially in N.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Covering designs and a strategy for many-event prediction markets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok - so it’s clear that above N=10, we’re starting to get in hot-water. Ten events is interesting, but it’s just not &lt;b&gt;that&lt;/b&gt; interesting. With N=10, the number of “atomic” events is 2**10 = 1024. But at 100 events, say, we’re talking about about 1.2676506e30 atomic events. A one with … thirty zeroes after it. Not. tractable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if we cheated? We really only need those 100 binary events in one market if people are going to be combining them into conditional bets. One way to skirt this exponential issue is to weaken the guarantee that any arbitrary combination of events is permitted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, you might instead guarantee that of 100 events, that you could always write a contract for any, say, three events in a conditional bet. Beyond three, it may be possible in some cases, but there’s no guarantee. So instead of having one giant, intractable market - you run a number of tractable markets that together contain every combination of events that you’re guaranteeing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To do this, we need to step into the world of covering designs. A covering design is a combinatorial concept that basically asks this question: Given a set of v elements, how many k-sized subsets of v do we need to guarantee that every possible t-length subset of v is present in one of the k-sized subsets?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put more succinctly by the&lt;a href=&quot;http://A (v,k,t)-covering design is a collection of k-element subsets, called blocks, of {1,2,...,v}, such that any t-element subset is contained in at least one block.&quot;&gt; La Jolla Covering Design Repository&lt;/a&gt; (LJCR): “A &lt;i&gt;(v,k,t)-covering design&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of k-element subsets, called blocks, of {1,2,…,v}, such that any t-element subset is contained in at least one block.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Covering designs are tricky beasts, and there is a lot of interesting math on them. For example, we know that there is a (99, 10, 3) covering design with 1768 blocks (available at the LJCR), but we don’t know of a (99, 10, 4) covering design with less than 36,980 blocks. That escalated quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing block size has the opposite effect.There is a (99, 12, 3) covering design with only 874 blocks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the general tradeoffs are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The higher the size of arbitrary combinations we allow, the more markets we have to run (this rises very quickly, although I'm not sure what the scaling is - exponential, factorial, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The higher the number of binary events we run in each market, the fewer markets we have to run, but the more intractable they are.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a “sweet spot” of possibilities, but it’s small. For example, it seems that (99, 10, 3) is a computationally tractable market: 1768 markets, each with 1024 atomic elements (or 10 binary elements), and guaranteeing any trader that any combination of three binary events can be priced and traded. And some combinations of up to 10 will also be tradeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;how v10r works&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;v10r needs a few parameters to get started. The first thing we need is a (v, k, t) covering design. This will give us the number of markets we’re running, the size of each market, and the size of the guarantee we can make about arbitrary combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we need to know what the initial liquidity we’d like the market to have, and how quickly it will rise as more trades are made in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need to know the fee we’re charging for each trade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Order comes in as a logical statement with binary events as logical variables. Assume that the order size is O units.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;v10r finds the markets that are “in play” with the given binary events and filters out the rest - assume that there are M markets “in play”. The markets that are “in play” are those that contain all of the binary events present in the order.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For each market, the logical statement is parsed into buy/sell orders for “atomic” events (the ordering of these events inside the q vector will be different in each market)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For each market, v10r computes the price change for O/M units&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The price changes across the M markets is summed and this price is presented to the trader along with the fee&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the price is accepted, the quantity changes are added to each of the M market's q vectors&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a major known issue here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The mathematics of the market as presented depend on the trades being completed in a linear sequence. But what if two people are quoted on trades concerning overlapping markets and they both accept?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon further inspection, this isn’t a terribly huge issue if:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The market is pretty liquid (the other person's trade would not have moved the prices that much anyway)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The prices are pretty efficient (meaning that there is no systematic bias towards increasing or decreasing the price)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two of these imply that price discrepancies due to concurrent trading will be small and will as much be in your favor as against it. We can further mitigate this issue by ensuring that prices are never more than some amount out of date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;v10r simulations and code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have simulations of the market available for public consumption at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tvladeck/v10r-simulations&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tvladeck/v10r-simulations&lt;/a&gt; and a semi-working implementation at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tvladeck/v10r&quot;&gt;https://github.com/tvladeck/v10r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simulations code should be relatively easy to follow if you understand the equations above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caveats: the implementation is really bad code. It’s almost certainly unreadable to anyone other than me. The “client” code relies on un-named gems, namely “GSL” and “Algorithms” and “Redis”. Other things probably don’t work. It relies on having a running Redis server that works as the middle layer between the client and server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The server code runs on clojure because I needed something that was easily multithreadable and had very good matrix libraries. Yay clojure!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The server is just constantly looking at the current order book and computing pre-baked values for the client to grab and use. To make the calculations tractable, I split the price function calculations between the client and server. The client parses the order, finds the right markets, and computes the “rest” of the price difference.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>BSPW</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/09/09/bspw/"/>
   <updated>2013-09-09T17:55:48-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/09/09/bspw</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What follows is the central lesson I learned from two years of working on a startup and making a ton of mistakes. A few caveats: I’ve never had a successful startup, and this resonates with my experiences and view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s commonly said and written, at least in the Bay Area: “build something people want” (BSPW). Yet, for my startup (Building Hero), this was the central, original reason we did not succeed. We built things, but they were not things that enough people wanted badly enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why can it be hard to BSPW? It's really two problems that reinforce each other:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Building a product (BS) produces tangible results whereas validating a problem (the PW part) does not&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It’s less clear how to validate a problem then it is to build a product&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the BS part is both more tangible and more fun. You can show it to your friends and feel good about the progress you’ve made. Not only that, if you’re an entrepreneur, it’s probably because you’re excited about technology and because you have fun building things. It’s also easier for you, probably, because you’re excited about it and it’s closer to what you normally do (i.e., writing code or designing mockups). And once you have a working product, it’s very easy to get excited about its capabilities. If you’re smart, you can probably convince yourself that it’s awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PW part is much less tangible. The result of validating a problem is a clear idea of what opportunity exists, an empathic connection with your potential market, and the beginnings of an understanding of how you might solve the problem. It’s a lot harder to show people; it’s harder to get excited about; by itself it’s unfulfilling both personally and socially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, because BS is so tangible, there is significantly less cognitive overhead in figuring out how to build the product then in validating the problem. It doesn’t take too long to put together a roadmap for how you’ll build something. PW is much less tangible; it’s not clear how to begin or even what you want to end up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, when faced with the choice of finishing up a webapp, which you can show your friends and pitch to investors, or individually emailing 100 people in your target market (much tougher to show your friends), it’s easy to see why many would choose the former and not the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Building Something Arbitrary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t PW before you BS, it’s likely that what you’re building is arbitrary. Through a commercial lens, it doesn’t have a reason for existence. It’s just one of the infinite things that could exist. Not one of the subset of things that needs to, or should, exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes entrepreneurs may get lucky and build something and find out that people want it too. Or some entrepreneurs may have such a strong creative vision that they can “see the future” and build into it. I guess I’m just not that way, so I need a more defined approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue is that starting with BS before PW is that it doesn’t equip you to evaluate how well you are doing. Really validating a problem should leave with you with an understanding of the assumptions that must be met before a product will succeed to the level you desire. Without this work below the tip of the iceberg, you’ll lack critical navigational ability: knowing what assumptions are being proven right and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, we got fooled by “vanity metrics” - the number of projects we were doing and the amount of revenue we were bringing in. We didn’t have defined assumptions at the outset that we could prove right or wrong. So we made decisions based on the wrong things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Find out what people want, then build it&lt;/h2&gt;

   <title>Startups and Photography</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/07/31/startups-and-photography/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-31T01:00:40-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/07/31/startups-and-photography</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;My principle creative outlet is photography. I’m (slowly) getting my photos up on Flickr - but most of my photos are up at @tvladeck on Instagram, and on &lt;a href=&quot;http://tomvladeck.tv&quot;&gt;tomvladeck.tv&lt;/a&gt; - my “media” domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve noticed recently that there a number of philosophical parallels between running an early-stage startup and being a photographer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two things &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A photo captures a moment in time through the view of a composition. A startup attacks a market with a product designed to solve a key problem. In both cases, there is a function of perception, and a function of action. You perceive the moment, and then compose the shot. You find the problem in a market, and design a product to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;[table]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Category, Photography, Startups&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perception, Moment, Market&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Action, Composition, Product&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[/table]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what about the team? And marketing? And… everything else? Remember I’m talking about an early stage startup. You &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; the team. You haven’t achieved product/market fit yet. And until you do, nothing else matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are lots of things to worry about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And even though only two things really matter, there are so many things to worry about. Especially if you’re really interested in photography or business more generally. But remember, these things only matter if they help you do better in the two things that really matter. These are means to an end - not ends themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[table]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photography, Startups&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lens, Tech Stack&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aperture/shutter settings, PR&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White Balance, Finance&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISO Settings, Accounting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[/table]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 14px;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is an art of exclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You define a photo by what you decide to leave out of the frame. You can’t create things in the frame, you can only eliminate all but a certain portion of the view in front of you. That portion becomes your shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A startup is in a similar place. Instead of a hemisphere of light to whittle down, there are endless problems and markets to choose from. But you can only choose one. You have to exclude.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Minimum Viable Decision</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/07/27/minimum-viable-decision/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-26T21:32:45-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/07/27/minimum-viable-decision</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Every organization I’ve ever worked with has struggled at some point with decision-making. Decision-making is tough. But there are ways to do it better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here some common problems we encounter in decision-making:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 14px;&quot;&gt;A decision is never made&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Decisions don't get enacted&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Decisions get revisited at random&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s clear why any of these three things can be majorly disruptive to an organization. A decision is a commitment to a certain course of action. If there are no decisions, it may be unclear what course of action is being pursued. If the commitment is not followed, the commitment was worthless in the first place. And finally, if the commitment is always up for questioning, it holds little value (it’s hardly a commitment at all).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why can decisions be hard to make and maintain? Here are a few common reasons (among many more):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 14px;&quot;&gt;There's a lot riding on the decision&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The consequences are highly ambiguous&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lack of buy-in across actors responsible for carrying out decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1.714285714;&quot;&gt;The more that’s riding on the decision, the harder it may be to make. The more pressure there will be to “get things right”, and therefore to spend a lot of time preparing. When consequences are ambiguous, it is harder to evaluate the available options and therefore to choose amongst them. In both cases, there is a strong temptation to revisit decisions before they’re carried out. We have an innate tendency to abhor paths that may contain regret. And of course we’ve all seen people exercise personal “pocket vetoes” on decisions by simply ignoring them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we address these issues in organizational decision-making? Many tangential arenas have codified practices that address similar concerns: agile software development, design thinking, and the validated-learning approach to product/startup development. Many areas of business fall outside these domains, but the approaches pioneered there can be applied more widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by them, I’ve toyed in my head with the concept of a “minimum viable decision” (MVD).  A minimum viable decision is the smallest decision of any consequence that can be taken as early as possible in any process. Instead of waiting to make the “right” decision, see if an MVD is available. Your team might never agree on what the “right” decision might be, but an MVD will help you chart a path forward and gain critical information about your problem domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More broadly, it’s about applying the concept of rapid iteration, feedback, and agility to decision making across &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; aspects of an organization, rather than just the areas where these concepts have gained the most traction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are some examples of an MVD?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[table]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of making a big decision, You make a small one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Promoting a junior developer to a management role, Have a junior developer manage a small project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commit to a direct marketing strategy, Try direct marketing in one neighborhood&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get an accountant, Talk to an accountant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hire a telesales role, Make 100 cold calls yourself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[/table]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the advantages of a minimum viable decision?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;MVDs require less organizational capital to take&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is easier to come to an agreement to an MVD than a Big Decision&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 1rem; line-height: 1;&quot;&gt;Often MVDs are almost always reversible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;MVDs are not &quot;bet the ____&quot; moments (e.g., the company, my career, this product, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;By reducing the impact of the decision, it's easier to implement&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Smaller decisions are easier to measure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not advocating that you don’t make big decisions. I am advocating that you arrive at them through a series of smaller, micro-decisions. As Jeff Bezos puts this whole concept brilliantly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When you look at something like, go back in time when we started working on Kindle almost seven years ago…. There you just have to place a bet. If you place enough of those bets, and if you place them early enough, none of them are ever betting the company. By the time you are betting the company, it means you haven’t invented for too long&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;Concluding thoughts: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 14px;&quot;&gt;Make smaller decisions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use smaller decisions to get information to feed into future decisions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Start making commitments early on in any deliberative process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If you get to a point of deep divergence in your team, you have waited too long&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Get to Yes.</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/07/16/get-to-yes/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-16T01:10:24-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/07/16/get-to-yes</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I recently listened to* &lt;em&gt;Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In&lt;/em&gt;, by Roger Fisher, Bruce Patton, and William Ury. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Yes-Negotiating-Agreement-Without/dp/0143118757&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon Link&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A negotiation is a process by which multiple parties with shared and diverging interests come to an agreement. This could be two nations at war, or it could be two friends figuring out where to eat for dinner. At an abstract level, both situations involve multiple parties figuring out how to meet their needs. The skills the authors discuss apply widely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why I think this book is a must-read for &lt;em&gt;everyone.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Most people, I think, will casually dismiss the domain of negotiation as belonging exclusively to the legal and business communities. But as the authors argue convincingly (but also somewhat briefly - I wish they’d gone further), everything done with more than one person involves negotiation in some sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As communications technologies and the &lt;i&gt;zeitgeist&lt;/i&gt; is drive organizations to a flatter, more loosely-coupled network of individual agents, effective negotiation becomes ever more important as a personal skill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so glad I came across the book. Here is my interpretation of the lessons they teach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;The Bogey.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The enemy of the book is “positional bargaining” - the form of negotiation that most of us are familiar with. You want ten, I want twenty, we settle at fifteen. You and I start with a position (a statement of the outcome we desire), and we move along a linear path between the two positions until we find a point somewhere in the middle that is acceptable to both parties. Or - nothing on that “line”** is acceptable and either the two parties give up, or one “wins”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the narrow range of outcomes, positional bargaining tends to create win/lose scenarios, which in turn breeds those expectations at the outset of a negotiation. Negotiators may go into a discussion really wanting to “win”; others may accept “losing” to preserve the relationship. The authors rightly reject win/lose or lose/win mentalities; if one party walks away from a negotiation feeling like they “lost”, it’s likely the agreement won’t produce a “win” for either party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The People and the Problem.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The authors repeat, as a mantra “separate the people from the problem”, but I think this is actually fairly inaccurate relative to the substance of their arguments. I would say it’s more accurate to describe their conclusions as “treat the people as an entirely separate problem”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are essentially two problems on the table during a negotiation: the central problem of how to satisfy the interests of both parties, and the emotional health of the people and relationships of the negotiating parties. There’s the “problem” and then there’s the “people problem”. The authors do not advocate ignoring the people problem - in fact they argue that it’s critical to spend real time and effort strengthening relationships between the two parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positions and Interests. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positions are statements that outline one possible way of meeting the interests of a negotiating party. What’s not important is the specific mix of things in the position; what’s important is that the mix is acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positions are usually expressed as a single point in a space of interests - but often they don’t hint at the dimensions in the negotiator’s interest-space (i.e., the things they care about). So look past the expressed positions to get to the underlying interests behind the position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Understand their interests better than they do.&lt;/em&gt; This should be your goal. Not only will you gain serious “people points” by showing that you care about solving &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; problem, but you will be better equipped to find a mutually advantageous solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, if you’re dealing with a landlord that wants you to move in quickly, understand why exactly that is - is it because there is a mortgage payment looming, or is it because she’s going away on vacation in a month and won’t be available to handle things while she’s away? The different underlying interests permit different ways of meeting those interests. Get past the positions and understand interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The interest space.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s likely that both negotiating parties have a very high dimensional interest space, although from the stated positions it may not appear so. After understanding the dimensions of the space you’re working in, “probe” the space by inventing options (“positions” pulled out of thin air) as a way of determining which regions of the interest space are acceptable (i.e. move in in a month and pay more rent vs. move in today and pay less). Make it clear that there are not commitments at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the natural consequence of getting off the “line” of positional bargaining. Once you open up space by looking at the interests behind the stated positions, explore it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The BATNA.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;est &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;lternative &lt;strong&gt;T&lt;/strong&gt;o a &lt;strong&gt;N&lt;/strong&gt;egotiated &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;greement. Every negotiator should go into a negotiation knowing both their own BATNA and the other side’s. Because a negotiator will only accept an agreement that improves on her BATNA, BATNAs are the source of relative strength in a negotiation - not “power” or resources &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt;. A very powerful company has little leverage over an employee that has received a competitive job offer from someone else.&lt;em&gt;
&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So understand your own BATNA, and work to improve it, before going in. Also understand their BATNA, and work to worsen it, if you can and need to. Filing suit against the other side is a common way of lowering their BATNA; now their BATNA includes defending themselves against a lawsuit. Improving your own BATNA and impairing the other sides changes the landscape of the negotiation in your favor - perhaps even before it begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;I hope you will read the book. For me, it was an instant classic. Negotiation is such a common thing in life, it’s shame it’s not taught more widely. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;*yes, I’m a shameless audiobook fan. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**In my head, I converted pretty much all of their discussion about positional bargaining, issues, etc., into a discussion about the benefits of operating in n-dimensional space as opposed to operating on a line (2d space).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A &#8220;Third Way&#8221; in Entrepreneurship</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/07/05/a-third-way-in-entrepreneurship/"/>
   <updated>2013-07-05T17:29:58-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/07/05/a-third-way-in-entrepreneurship</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurship is often portrayed as an endeavor in which the entrepreneur has to essentially go crazy to succeed. Extreme dedication, total distortion of the work/life balance, and very high risk are some of the hallmarks of our conception of starting a new business (or even more risky, starting a new business with a new business model or product).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, entrepreneurs are pressured to maintain a totally positive face to the outside world about the state of their company. In San Francisco, “we’re killing it” is almost now an inside joke because of the ubiquity of that response when someone asks an entrepreneur how their company is faring. Most of these companies are not “killing it”, and the entrepreneurs probably know that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;It’s actually almost folk-wisdom that this quality (believing your company is “killing it” at all times) is a necessary mental quality for an entrepreneur. If they could be completely honest with themselves, the thinking goes, they would never be able to face the consistent stream of failures and setbacks without giving up. But maintaining this facade is hard, and it only makes the risks higher; a less than satisfactory end result now means abrogating promises and not meeting expectations that you yourself helped create. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One has to think that there is a way to run a company that doesn’t exact such a toll. Leaders in the field of startup management, especially Eric Reis, have outlined new ways of thinking about starting a new business that permit new ways of behaving. Instead of being deterministic (i.e., the entrepreneur is in control of what the company will be and do, and effort will determine success) and linear (i.e., there is constant progress towards success), most startups are nondeterministic (you may succeed but you will not control how) and nonlinear (you will experience small failures constantly until you succeed, perhaps wildly). Deterministic/linear thinkers (or those who perceive that others think that way) are under more pressure to maintain this facade relative to nondeterministic/nonlinear thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt;In all, I think there’s a different way to be an entrepreneur. One that encourages work/life balance. One that doesn’t demand a stark dissonance between your public face and private reality. One that recognizes and embraces the nonlinear nature of startups - i.e., that it’s ok not to be “killing it” all the time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height: 1.714285714; font-size: 1rem;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Products need three things</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/06/28/products-need-three-things/"/>
   <updated>2013-06-28T11:27:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/06/28/products-need-three-things</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;To solve a pain point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be defensible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To be scalable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solving a pain point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A product must create value - but creating value is a subset of this criterion. Good products solve real problems - problems that people &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; solve one way or the other. OK products are &amp;#8220;nice to haves&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You only get paid if you solve a problem. Solving someone&amp;#8217;s problem is why people would ever buy your product in the first place.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about Facebook, the iPhone, Instagram? People got on just fine before these things - what pain point did they solve? Well, &lt;strong&gt;great&lt;/strong&gt; products &lt;em&gt;create new problems that can only be solved by the product itself&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;When Facebook became popular and everyone got on it, you had a new problem: your friends were all sharing things on Facebook and you weren&amp;#8217;t. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defensibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ok, so you&amp;#8217;ve ID&amp;#8217;d a pain point. What&amp;#8217;s stopping your product from becoming a commodity? Is it the technology - i.e., is no one able to replicate your product because of IP or trade secrets? Is it network effects? Is it economies of scale?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Without defensibility, you may still make money, but you&amp;#8217;re going to be competing for scraps with the rest of the market. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;If solving a pain point is why people would buy &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; product at all, defensibility is why people would continue to buy &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scalability, in my mind, is the confluence of two factors: a large potential market and a viable growth model. Consider this: you are the sole owner of wedding photos for a recent wedding. Your potential customers really want to see the photos (pain point) and you&amp;#8217;re the only provider (defensibility). So - you&amp;#8217;ve got the makings of a great product. But, there were 100 people at the wedding, 50 more that didn&amp;#8217;t know but care enough to see the photos, each willing to pay $50 for it. Too bad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;You fell over because the market was too small.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well what about a big potential market? You can still fall over if you don&amp;#8217;t have a viable growth model to eat up the market. The growth model essentially means that your cost of user acquisition is lower than your customer lifetime value. I&amp;#8217;m sure there are other nuances, but that&amp;#8217;s pretty much it. Even if you solve a problem for someone, if you&amp;#8217;re paying more to deliver the product to them (with &amp;#8220;deliver&quot; meaning everything from the averaged costs of developing the product to creating it to marketing it to supporting it and beyond) than you can receive for it, you don&amp;#8217;t have a viable growth model. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So if solving a pain point is why people would by this product, and defensibility is why people would buy your product, scalability is why you&amp;#8217;ll be able to create a business around your product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concluding thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;So solving a pain point, defensibility, and scalability are all necessary. But are they together sufficient? I haven&amp;#8217;t thought that through, but my hunch is that they are. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Escape from Camp 14</title>

   <updated>2013-06-25T20:01:02-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/06/26/escape-from-camp-14</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0143122916&quot;&gt;This book&lt;/a&gt; is amazing. I listened to it* recently and I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is a hugely heartwrenching story about a man &lt;strong&gt;born&lt;/strong&gt; into a North Korean slave-labor camp - sentenced at birth to a life within the boundaries of a camp, where he would be worked, humiliated, and starved until he ultimately died. The story of everyone else that becomes a prisoner - by birth or otherwise, at one of these camps. But he escaped. The only person to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is the story of his life, his escape, and his transformation into a free person. &lt;span&gt;The story is told exceptionally well and is peppered with great detail about North Korea&amp;#8217;s history and current situation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*As an audiobook&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Failure is how things are optimized</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/02/18/failure-is-how-things-are-optimized/"/>
   <updated>2013-02-18T15:27:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/02/18/failure-is-how-things-are-optimized</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I read Paul Graham; I am a big fan of his writing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day he wrote: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things are always breaking at YC [Y Combinator, his company], because our strategy is to find bottlenecks by hitting them. That may sound irresponsible, but in practice it&amp;#8217;s the way most complex systems get optimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s play with his words, though, and instead speak about &amp;#8220;high performance&quot; systems as opposed to complex systems. Until last night it had not occurred to me what the impact of that statement would be, if true. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement is almost a tautology in the sense that it is self-proving. A high-performance system is, almost by definition, something that has reached, or almost reached, the limits of performance. If it hasn&amp;#8217;t, then it isn&amp;#8217;t high-performance. And something that is close to the limits of its performance will fail, periodically. And by failing, you can learn why it failed, and improve. But only by crossing the threshold of what was previously thought possible can one extend the boundaries of performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it makes sense, and it feels true. And if you concede that it is true, a number of things suddenly fall into place. But they come from one major thing: failure should be an objective in-and-of-itself. One should seek to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a personal note, this felt like a major insight for me. Of course, I&amp;#8217;m not the first to this party. Thomas Watson&amp;#8217;s quote about doubling your failure rate comes to mind. But for me these sorts of things never had a real grounding, and they never quite landed on me. But now, for me at least, the reasoning is more clear. Failure is not just an indicator of ambition or tenacity. More fundamentally, it is a sine qua non of outsized success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fundamentally, this implies a shift from thinking &amp;#8220;what do I want to do next&quot; &amp;#8212; the implication being of course: &amp;#8220;what should I succeed at (or try to succeed at) next?&quot; &amp;#8212; to thinking &amp;#8220;how do I want to fail? How do I want to purposefully reach beyond what I think I can do?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve heard of the concept of a &amp;#8220;failure resume&quot; a document showing initiatives undertaken, but ultimately unachieved by the writer as something used to judge candidates in a hiring process &amp;#8212; alongside a traditional resume, showing successes. What would the optimal balance of these two documents be? Full-up on one, and nothing on the other would indicate either a lack of ambition (no failures), or an inability to learn from mistakes (no successes). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that you would want these entries to be somewhat in balance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is failure, then? Is it an indicator? Is it a result? It seems to me that (like success, its sibling with a flipped sign) it is an instrument that you use (to advance yourself as a person), and that, by itself, it should carry no positive or negative connotation. But, for better or for worse, it seems to come with a personal stigma, which must be overcome.&lt;/p&gt;

Other areas may pick up the slack — but only if we properly incentivize investment in the right places. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsidized crop insurance distorts the financial equation for farmers. It may very well be that many farmers are sitting on land that no longer offers a true risk-adjusted opportunity for profit. But when the government literally takes risk out of the equation, there is no incentive to do anything different. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>The Ideological Turing Test</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/01/08/the-ideological-turing-test/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-07T21:01:48-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/01/08/the-ideological-turing-test</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A few days ago I added a single line to the “about me” section of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a big believer in the Ideological Turing Test&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well &amp;#8212; what is that exactly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s talk about the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Turing Test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This test, proposed by Alan Turing, key inventor of computation, defines a key milestone in artificial intelligence. The idea is that if a human is systematically unable to tell machine from human in the course of conversation, then the machine could be said to be “thinking” &amp;#8212; like a human. To pass the test, of course, the machine has to be very good at imitating a human being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that brings us to our variation. I am sure that versions of this idea have existed for a very long time, but the genesis of this idea in the form that it reached me &lt;a href=&quot;http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2011/06/the_ideological.html&quot;&gt;can be traced to Bryan Caplan&lt;/a&gt;. The idea is that in a debate between two opponents, the competitor that can more ably imitate the other’s argument is the more credible of the two. Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/66643&quot;&gt;Mill states it well&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;#8220;He who knows only his own side of the case knows little of that.&quot;  If someone can correctly explain a position but continue to disagree with it, that position is less likely to be correct.  And if ability to correctly explain a position leads almost automatically to agreement with it, that position is more likely to be correct.  &amp;#8230;  It&amp;#8217;s not a perfect criterion, of course, especially for highly idiosyncratic views.  But the ability to pass ideological Turing tests - to state opposing views as clearly and persuasively as their proponents - is a genuine symptom of objectivity and wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is unbelievably spot-on. Caplan, and others, go further and suggest that in long-running debates (like those between different camps of economists, which is the sort of conflict that inspired Caplan to develop this idea) that actual competitions be organized to determine a winner. But in general the logic of this thinking speaks for itself. In so many mini-debates I see the opponents mis-stating each others’ positions to the point where the points of contention are undefined, or at least understood differently by each participant. In these cases, no progress is made through discourse, and that’s a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to repeat a homely adage, “Seek first to understand, then to be understood.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Is socially responsible investing worth it?</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/01/05/is-socially-responsible-investing-worth-it/"/>
   <updated>2013-01-04T20:00:06-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2013/01/05/is-socially-responsible-investing-worth-it</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines&quot;&gt;Betteridge’s Law of Headlines&lt;/a&gt;, you may infer that the correct answer to this question is “no”. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was inspired to write this post while perusing the latest scandal around Herbalife, a very large company which appears to be a giant pyramid scheme. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-ackmans-herbalife-presentation-2012-12?op=1&quot;&gt;This presentation&lt;/a&gt;, done by a prominent hedge fund that has taken a massive short position, is an impressive takedown of the company. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://factsaboutherbalife.com/&quot;&gt;Here is an accompanying website.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the company produces cash for shareholders, the thesis is that the company will eventually deteriorate due to legal issues and business model unsustainability. The most interesting take, however, came from &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2012/12/27/bet-against-ackman-some-hedge-funds-buy-herbalife-shares/&quot;&gt;an investor with a slightly different take&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am utterly convinced by everything in Bill Ackman’s presentation except the final conclusion — that Herbalife’s stock will collapse,” said Hempton, who also is a noted short seller. ”I took a long position on Christmas Eve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I suspect that Herbalife is so profitable and so powerful they will see Mr. Ackman’s attack off — and the easiest way to do that is to buy back stock (and make the stock go up),” he adds. “Mr. Ackman has given them the incentive to return their huge (but tainted) profits to shareholders (and I plan to be a recipient shareholder).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This illustrates a fundamental problem with socially responsible investing (SRI), or paying a premium for one type of asset over another, holding relative risk and return constant: there will always be people that only care about the money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means two things will happen: first, this group will bid back up the price of non-socially-responsible investments (because they only care about return characteristics), confounding any attempt to create a non-financial premium. Second, this opportunity to correct the price imbalance just gives this group an opportunity to make more money! So not only should SRI not have a lasting effect, but it should also reward non-SRI investors in the bargain!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, imagine that there are two groups of people (“do-gooders” and “cold-hearts”) and two types of investments (“SRI” and “non-SRI”). Let’s imagine that the SRI and non-SRI investments offer the same risk/return characteristics and are priced at par — 100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that to the do-gooders, the SRI assets have a non-financial premium of 20, and the non-SRI assets have a non-financial premium of -20, so the two types of assets are worth 120 and 80, respectively. To the cold-hearts, there is no non-financial premium; both are just worth 100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we modeled this in two stages, first the do-gooders would sell their non-SRI assets to buy SRI assets until they hit their equilibrium prices of 120 and 80, respectively. Then, the cold-hearts would just undo all that, effectively arbitraging across the two (financially) equivalent classes of assets, until their prices were back at 100/100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this interplay would not happen in discrete stages &amp;#8212; it happens continuously &amp;#8212; but the effect is the same. SRI is a broken concept. To drive investment towards the things that we want, we need to make them more profitable, plain and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>From A Good Friend Who Decided After A Lifetime Of</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from a good friend who decided after a lifetime of gun ownership to sell his assault weapons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as bans/controls going forward, if the line is going to be meaningful, it has to be drawn at semiautomatic weapons with detachable magazines.  This is lenient enough to allow bolt-action rifles, which need the bolt to be worked between each shot and are the overwhelming practical preference for hunters and marksmen alike, while being strict enough to exclude what an almost comically ill-informed media describes as &amp;#8220;military-grade&quot; weapons.  The common denominator between the handgun that a gang member uses on the street and the AR-15 that a schizophrenic uses to kill moviegoers is not that they were designed for military use in combat, but rather that they both a) fire one shot per trigger pull without reloading between shots, and b) accept rounds from a detachable magazine of varying size that can be switched out for a fresh one in a matter of a couple seconds.  It&amp;#8217;s this technology that escalates a shooting from one or two dead to twenty or thirty dead&amp;#8212; you can get more rounds in the air faster, and there&amp;#8217;s almost no reload time in which you&amp;#8217;re vulnerable.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s why I&amp;#8217;m already frustrated that people are talking about renewing the Assault Weapons Ban of 1994.  It was a meaningless piece of legislation, because rather than addressing what really makes these weapons so potent, it defined an assault weapon as any firearm that has more than two of an enumerated list of features&amp;#8212; things like a pistol grip, a bayonet lug, a collapsible buttstock, a bayonet lug, a detachable magazine (thankfully), or a grenade launcher attachment.  So what happened is that manufacturers continued making the same firearms, but they would simply hack off the bayonet lug or pin the buttstock in the extended position.  Using these tricks, the rifle that Lanza used would have been completely legal during the ban.  I bought one myself during the ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Right after Sandy passed through the East Coast, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomvladeck.com/post/34671240064/hurricane-sandy-climate-change-and-market-signals&quot;&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area that will be interesting to observe following this Hurricane is the insurance market, as insurers revisit the premia they charge for wind, water, and fire insurance. If they decide that the threat of hurricanes on the highly populated East Coast is higher in a changing or different climate, than the cost to reinsurers to, in turn, insure themselves through catastrophe bonds or other insurance-linked-securities will drive primary market prices higher. Higher premia for these things will send a signal that it is better (all other things equal) to live or develop elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Paying for Climate Change</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2012/11/26/paying-for-climate-change/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-26T14:52:39-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2012/11/26/paying-for-climate-change</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;For anyone who, like me, is interested in how our global economy will adapt to climate change, there is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/opinion/sunday/paying-for-future-catastrophes.html&quot;&gt;must read article in the new york times&lt;/a&gt; that addresses many of the questions I raised &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomvladeck.com/post/34671240064/hurricane-sandy-climate-change-and-market-signals&quot;&gt;in a previous post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, risk premia have been rising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the quickening pace of disaster, those who want insurance or are required to buy it now face much higher costs in risky areas. Premiums for homeowners’ insurance (which covers wind damage) doubled in Florida between 2002 and 2007, tripling in some areas after the 2004-5 hurricane seasons, if insurance was available at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many insurers have raised their premiums because of increased risk estimates, higher cost of reinsurance (insurers transfer part of their risk to international reinsurers), the requirement by regulators and rating agencies that insurers hold more capital in order to reduce the likelihood of insolvency, and the need to provide shareholders with an attractive return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I speculated that this might be the case, but it appears that rising prices are already occurring. This is the most objective indication that we have that climate change is already underway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurance market prices are effectively representations of distributions. The price of car insurance is a representation of the likelihood that you&amp;#8217;ll get into an accident. The distribution for 18-25 year-olds is different than for 30-40 year-olds, and the prices are different. Since &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tomvladeck.com/post/35070174347/in-my-last-post-i-mentioned-that-climate-change-is&quot;&gt;our climate is a distribution&lt;/a&gt;, insurance price changes for climate-dependent phenomena should be an indicator that the distribution has changed (or, in other words, that the climate has changed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that there is a competitive market for climate-dependent insurance in Florida, the evidence cited above is &lt;strong&gt;unbiased evidence&lt;/strong&gt; that climate change has occurred and is occurring. Setting a price too high will mean lost business for the company, and j&lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118886673597616437.html&quot;&gt;udging by how many people have dropped their wind coverage&lt;/a&gt;, this consequence has been suffered by the insurance companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this important? In my opinion, it&amp;#8217;s that &lt;strong&gt;the market is telling us that climate change is happening&lt;/strong&gt;. Although the scientific evidence is staggering, it has never been quite enough to convince many. Market evidence is rarely cited, and I think it deserves more attention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second point that the authors make is relevant to adaptation: subsidized public flood insurance (i.e., flood insurance that not only is administered publicly, but is also run at below break-even prices), and homeowners dropping other forms of climate-dependent insurance (flood, wind, etc.) is skewing incentives and is promoting increased development and the perpetuation of development in areas that are relatively more exposed to climate risks. This is a problem. The market signals of climate change should be felt and increased prices borne by those who are ultimately exposed to the risks. Why? People need the incentive to move, and as the world changes, our geography and our economy need to change along with it (and, actually, ahead of the changes if possible). &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Nate Silvers Forecast Would Have Done Better Had</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2012/11/09/nate-silvers-forecast-would-have-done-better-had/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-09T11:33:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2012/11/09/nate-silvers-forecast-would-have-done-better-had</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;[gallery]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nate Silver&amp;#8217;s forecast would have done better had he gotten a few wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really like 538 and they have done a great job. I have one minor quibble with how they represent their forecasts and their results. 538&amp;#8217;s forecasts are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; binary predictions, they are probability estimates. Meaning, that of all the races he projects to be at 70% probability, the winner should be the leading candidate 70% of the time - not 100% of the time. But 538 and many others are saying that he got 50/50 states right, and that confuses the picture a lot. What does it mean to call Florida &amp;#8220;correctly&quot; when the model gave Obama a 50.1 chance of winning?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The example I used when explaining it to some friends was that if a weatherman, for 10 straight days, said there was a 55% chance of rain, and it rained every day - you could say that the weatherman correctly predicted the weather every day, but the correct interpretation is that his estimates were too low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code below simply takes 538&amp;#8217;s estimates right before the election, with the probability figure being that which 538 assigned to the eventual winner. The code simply assumes that 538&amp;#8217;s probability estimates were exactly correct, and shows the distribution of states that would be in error in a run of 10,000 simulations. As you can see, if 538&amp;#8217;s estimates were exactly correct, it&amp;#8217;s  significantly more likely that he would have gotten 1, 2, or 3 states wrong than none at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that his estimates &lt;em&gt;weren&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; spot on - there is a good chance they were - I only want to point out that there is a little bit more going on than saying that 538 got 50/50 states &amp;#8220;right&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>You brought words to a numbers fight</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2012/11/05/you-brought-words-to-a-numbers-fight/"/>
   <updated>2012-11-05T17:30:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2012/11/05/you-brought-words-to-a-numbers-fight</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;One of the great joys of this election for nerds like me is following the debate about&lt;em&gt; how &lt;/em&gt;to track the election. There are a few competing models available to look through, such as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://election.princeton.edu/&quot;&gt;Princeton Election Consortium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://votamatic.org/&quot;&gt;Votamatic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight &lt;/a&gt;- and even &lt;a href=&quot;http://unskewedpolls.com/&quot;&gt;UnSkewed Polls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of these modelers has taken a different approach to a difficult problem - namely how to estimate the outcome of an election using available data. There are tradeoffs around each approach and there&amp;#8217;s a fairly lively debate about which approach is most enlightening. I am excited to see how they fare tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, you have a bunch of contributors making proclamations about what will happen, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theblaze.com/stories/romney-landslide-here-are-the-biggest-names-predicting-it-how-it-will-happen/&quot;&gt;seemingly untethered to the evidence available to them&lt;/a&gt;. They only show the results of their internal model (should there be one), not the model itself. Obviously many of them are motivated by something other than the &amp;#8220;search for truth&quot;, but even if they were, their contribution is generally useless. Here&amp;#8217;s why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, a model can be useful even if its predictions are wrong. Especially when it is predicting things that are compositional in nature (i.e. not single events in and of themselves, but composed of many events). Second, a model can make a correct prediction even when the model itself is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most importantly, when two projections disagree, it&amp;#8217;s impossible to work out why they disagree unless we know how the models that produced them work in the first place. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last point is the most important. Without a model, you are treating projection like opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So: come with a model. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>In My Last Post I Mentioned That Climate Change Is</title>

&lt;p&gt;In my last post I mentioned that climate change is defined as a change in a distribution. I thought it might help to see what that looks like. The data that you see here is &lt;em&gt;observed &lt;/em&gt;data, not a projection or a model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What it shows is the distribution of summer temperatures in North Americarelative to what is normal for that time of year. The horizontal units are in terms of standard deviations, instead of degrees. So a very hot day (i.e., 10 degrees greater than normal) would be plotted as +2 standard deviations (obviously I&amp;#8217;m making up the numbers here for effect).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gist is that climate has already changed (the probability of the shift you see being a product of random variation is vanishingly small). If you believe that humans are the cause of this shift, then you should believe it will continue to change. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Hurricane Sandy, Climate Change, and Market Signals</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2012/10/31/hurricane-sandy-climate-change-and-market-signals/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-30T20:46:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2012/10/31/hurricane-sandy-climate-change-and-market-signals</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A question that will surely be considered over the coming weeks is whether or not Hurricane Sandy was caused, in whole or part, by climate change. A &lt;a href=&quot;http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/did-global-warming-contribute-to-hurricane-sandys-devastation/?hp&quot;&gt;NYT article&lt;/a&gt; has already asked this very question.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is defined as a change in a distribution (the climate being a distribution of weather outcomes). Even if our models were perfect, and we knew with certainty that hurricanes were x% more likely to occur this year than last year, we would not be able to say that climate change caused this hurricane to occur, or this hurricane to be stronger than it otherwise would have been. Only with a set of observations can you observe changes to a distribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compounding this, our models aren&amp;#8217;t perfect, and climate data is very noisy. The best that we can say is that, for any given time period in the future, on the East Coast of the US, hurricanes are &lt;em&gt;probably more likely &lt;/em&gt;occur (notice there are two qualifications). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our climatic models are good, but we don&amp;#8217;t have total confidence in them, so we can only say that they are &amp;#8220;probably&quot; correct. Second, even if we did have total confidence in them, they don&amp;#8217;t make ironclad predictions for any length of time - only probabilistic assertions - so we can only say that hurricanes are &amp;#8220;more likely&quot; pr &amp;#8220;x% more likely&quot; - not that &lt;em&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; hurricanes will occur.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very difficult for the average person to process, and it is very hard to make forward-looking decisions with this type of information. Fortunately, we have mechanisms that are very good at cutting through this type of very noisy, probabilistic data to provide a clear signal: markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area that will be interesting to observe following this Hurricane is the insurance market, as insurers revisit the premia they charge for wind, water, and fire insurance. If they decide that the threat of hurricanes on the highly populated East Coast is higher in a changing or different climate, than the cost to reinsurers to, in turn, insure themselves through catastrophe bonds or other insurance-linked-securities will drive primary market prices higher. Higher premia for these things will send a signal that it is better (all other things equal) to live or develop elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have little doubt that markets will evolve to provide the necessary signal; in fact &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.artemis.bm/blog/2011/10/11/hurricane-derivatives-trade-in-record-volumes-during-2011/&quot;&gt;exotic securities&lt;/a&gt; are being developed to more directly trade and price this risk. The real question is: given the pace of climate change, and the lifespan of our at-risk capital stock (those in areas exposed to negative impacts of climate change), how much stranded capital will we be left with? Think: agricultural communities where the climate become unfavorable for crops, or communities exposed to high levels of hurricane risk. Did the condo developer on the Jersey Shore correctly price this risk in five years ago? Will she today? The answers to these types of questions will determine, in large part, the extent of climate change&amp;#8217;s impact on humanity. &lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Misunderstanding the issues</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2012/10/19/misunderstanding-the-issues/"/>
   <updated>2012-10-19T14:22:00-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2012/10/19/misunderstanding-the-issues</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;David Brooks writes a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/opinion/brooks-a-sad-green-story.html?src=me&amp;amp;ref=general&amp;amp;_r=0&quot;&gt;thoughtful article&lt;/a&gt; today on the Obama administration&amp;#8217;s attempts to spur innovation in clean technology, and he recites a common fallacy in the environmental policy space. Namely, that the problem of technological substitution can be solved through market-price corrections alone. This is why he laments the subsidies granted to early-stage technology firms and pines for a carbon tax instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One can bucket mitigation technologies into roughly three groups. Imagine that there is a cost curve in front of you, like the McKinsey curve, with the cost of each technology on the y-axis, and the amount of mitigation opportunity on the x-axis. Imagine that these technologies are ordered from left to right, lowest to highest cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two important horizontal lines to draw through this graph. The first is at y = 0. It&amp;#8217;s hard to beleive, but there are mitigation technologies that actually pay for themselves, and then some. These technologies are negative cost. There a host of reasons that they don&amp;#8217;t get deployed / implemented; let&amp;#8217;s call these policy issues &amp;#8220;Barriers&quot;. The first thing to understand is that since these already are profitable, it&amp;#8217;s not clear that a price correction will solve the underlying issue. Perhaps making them even more profitable will do the trick, but perhaps not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now imagine that we agree that there is a social cost of each ton of CO2-equivalent; let&amp;#8217;s call this cost SCC (the social cost of carbon). The next important line is at y = SCC. If you implemented a cap-and-trade or carbon-tax scheme, presumably all the mitigation opportunity below this line would be implemented. Let&amp;#8217;s call these policy issues &amp;#8220;Incentives&quot;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there are opportunities above the y = SCC line. These technologies would not be implemented even with a market price on carbon, because they are too expensive. The aim of policies targeting these technologies should be to bring the cost down to below the y = SCC line, or to &amp;#8220;bend the curve&quot;, so to speak. Let&amp;#8217;s call this group &amp;#8220;Innovation&quot;. Now, you could argue that establishing a price on carbon would incentivize entrpreneurs to bring the cost of these technologies down, but that argument works for any price on carbon, even 0 (i.e., there is always an incentive to bring the cost of technologies below the incumbent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing that the speed of cost reduction at y = 0 has not been what we need, and not knowing what it would be at y = SCC, it makes intuitive sense to tackle the cost reduction problem directly for technologies that are at y &amp;gt; SCC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn&amp;#8217;t change the outcome whatsoever. So far this race seems safely in the bag for Obama, with this informal model predicting a 97% likelihood of him winning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year we heard friends of ours were getting a divorce. Lauren and I were surprised because they looked like the happy couple over so many years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But as the old saying goes, it’s hard to tell what’s going on behind closed doors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week we &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;watched Mitt Romney behind closed doors&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

   <title>opinions suck</title>
   <link href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/2012/08/24/opinions-suck/"/>
   <updated>2012-08-24T18:24:30-04:00</updated>
   <id>http://www.tomvladeck.com/2012/08/24/opinions-suck</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;one of the most valuable lessons i&amp;#8217;ve internalized recently is that opinions suck. they suck for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(1) they are subjective, and impossible to verify or falsify. how do you make any decisions based on these inputs? (*)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(2) most of the time &amp;#8220;differences of opinion&quot; are actually different projections of how the facts actually are. this shit wrankles me to no end. consider: &amp;#8220;i think it will rain tomorrow&quot; &amp;#8220;i don&amp;#8217;t think it will rain tomorrow&quot;. there is a big difference between imperfect information and subjectivity. most differences of opinion are not in fact disagreements over subjective matters, but different projections over (unknown) objective facts. in these cases &amp;#8220;let&amp;#8217;s agree to disagree&quot; (or any of its variants) is a shitty response. the answer is to get more data or to track which imperfect model of the world performs better in explaining it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(*) the answer is two-fold. the first is the &amp;#8220;marissa mayer&quot; approach, which is to say &amp;#8220;if you have data, let&amp;#8217;s see the data, but if you only have opinions we&amp;#8217;re going to go with mine&quot;. the second is to parameterize the difference of opinion and drive the problem from (1) (an actual difference of opinion) to (2) (different projections over unknown facts). For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Person 1: I think A is better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Person 2: I think B is better&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Person 3: How do do we measure what our customers like? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persons 1 &amp;amp; 2: These easy-to-measure actions&amp;#8217;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Person 3: Let&amp;#8217;s measure them and A/B test, then we&amp;#8217;ll know&lt;/p&gt;
