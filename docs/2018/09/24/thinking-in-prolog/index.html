    <h1>Thinking in Prolog</h1>

<div id="post">
<p>I’ve been having a lot of fun working on a side project written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Prolog</a>, which is a <em>logical</em> programming language. It has been incredibly difficult to wrap my mind around how it works but I’m getting there, and I can see that “there” is a pretty powerful place. It makes me wonder why this paradigm isn’t used for more applications.</p>

<p>It turns out (you may already know this if you write code) that programming languages work <em>very differently</em> depending on which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paradigm</a> they use.</p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<p>Common programming paradigms include:</p>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>imperative</strong> in which the programmer instructs the machine how to change its state,
<ul>
 	<li><strong>procedural</strong> which groups instructions into procedures,</li>
 	<li><strong>object-oriented</strong> which groups instructions together with the part of the state they operate on,</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>declarative</strong> in which the programmer merely declares properties of the desired result, but not how to compute it
<ul>
 	<li><strong>functional</strong> in which the desired result is declared as the value of a series of function applications,</li>
 	<li><strong>logic</strong> in which the desired result is declared as the answer to a question about a system of facts and rules,</li>
 	<li><strong>mathematical</strong> in which the desired result is declared as the solution of an optimization problem</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ve found functional programming to be so intuitive and object-oriented (probably the most common paradigm today) to be so counterintuitive that I almost always write my programs in a functional style.</p>

<p>In a logic program, you write down a set of facts and rules. That’s it. That’s your program. And then you run the program by asking it if it can find a solution to a new query.</p>

<p>Prolog in particular is built around a type of logical statement called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_clause" target="_blank">Horn clause</a> that basically reads “X is true if Y and Z are true”. In Prolog that would look like:</p>
<pre>X :- Y, Z.</pre>
<p>A more complete program (but still tiny) program would look like:</p>
<pre>food(sandwich). % declaring a fact that sandwich is a food
drink(water). % declaring that water is a drink

meal(X, Y) :- food(X), drink(Y).
% X and Y (variables) make a meal if X is a food &amp; Y is a drink</pre>
<p>When you run this program, you’ll get:</p>
<pre>?- meal(X, Y).
X = sandwich,
Y = water.</pre>
<p>That’s a toy example, but you can see how quickly the complexity could build up with ever-more relationships and so on. I’m working on writing a program to solve the common wedding-seating problem where you have a set number of tables, people you want to sit next to each other, and people that you want to sit at different tables. It’s fun.</p>
