<p>Over the past few years I’ve experienced with meditation. I’ve always been an “in my own head” guy and — like many millennials — I’ve turned to meditation in an attempt to wrangle more control over the thoughts and feelings spinning in my brain.</p>

<p>I’ve got much more to say about my experience with meditation, but for now I’ll share one transformative (and perhaps banal) personal insight I had the other day.</p>

<p>I used to be a <a href="http://headspace.com/" target="_blank">Headspace</a> guy, but recently I’ve been trying <a href="https://www.10percenthappier.com" target="_blank">10% Happier</a> and am really loving the variety of approaches and teachers. One meditation I’ve done a few times is called “The Reset” and is designed for times when you’re feeling overwhelmed and totally crazy busy.</p>

<p>The line the teacher used is: “whatever else ‘busy-ness’ is, it’s also a thought”. And it is! Busy-ness is <em>real</em> in the sense that you may have way more things to do then can reasonably be done; you may be running late; etc. But it’s also the experience of feeling “I’m so busy” “I have so much to do” “I’m so overwhelmed” etc. And those are thoughts. They are prompted by the real-life experience you’re having, but they are also independent of them.</p>

<p>Meditation teaches you to identify, label, and ultimately dismiss thoughts on command. So why not do so with busy-ness? It can be done.</p>

<p>But there’s nothing special about the experience of “busy-ness”. Whatever else <strong>__ is, __</strong> is a thought. You can learn to say, “oh, that’s me being angry”, or “oh, that’s me being nervous” or “oh, that’s me feeling slighted”, and so on.</p>

<p>So am I trying to say that I’ve reached this level of enlightenment and that I can choose not to feel busy, get angry, or feel anxious? No — not at all. Or at least not in all situations all the time. But, sometimes, I can. Maybe about 10% of the time. And that’s a pretty good improvement.</p>
