    <h1>Routines</h1>
</div>

<div id="post">
<p>I have read many times that successful people often have very stringent routines. The book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307273601/dailrout-20" target="_blank">Daily Routines</a> is literally just a list of different habits of famous artists and creatives. You can go to the <a href="http://dailyroutines.typepad.com/daily_routines/artists/" target="_blank">accompanying blog</a> to get an idea.</p>

<p>The most important constant is that there is a routine at all; even if there aren’t many similarities across routines (some work in the morning, some in the evening, and so on).</p>

<p>I’ve always struggled to create a routine for myself. For instance, I exercise about 70% of days. But the <em>time</em> I exercise is hardly the same from day to day. Breakfast? Who knows? Lunch? Could be anywhere from 11am to 4pm. And so on.</p>

<p>This writing — every day when I have my coffee, I write a short blog post — is an(other) attempt at creating a rhythm for myself.</p>

<p>For for the most part where I’ve landed is the idea of a daily checklist; I have a few things that I want to do <strong>every</strong> day, and I hit the x on each one as I do them. And as I go about my day, I’m thinking about getting those things done. I use <a href="https://www.stridesapp.com/" target="_blank">Strides</a> to do that (which is, for instance, how I know I work out about 70% of days).</p>

<p>The checklist helps keep me on track, but I still want to get that rhythm down.</p>
