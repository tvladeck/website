<ol><li>To solve a pain point</li>
<li>To be defensible</li>
<li>To be scalable</li>
</ol><p><strong>Solving a pain point</strong></p>
<p>A product must create value - but creating value is a subset of this criterion. Good products solve real problems - problems that people <em>must</em> solve one way or the other. OK products are &#8220;nice to haves".</p>
<p><span>You only get paid if you solve a problem. Solving someone&#8217;s problem is why people would ever buy your product in the first place.</span></p>
<p>What about Facebook, the iPhone, Instagram? People got on just fine before these things - what pain point did they solve? Well, <strong>great</strong> products <em>create new problems that can only be solved by the product itself</em>.</p>
<p><span>When Facebook became popular and everyone got on it, you had a new problem: your friends were all sharing things on Facebook and you weren&#8217;t. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Defensibility</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span>Ok, so you&#8217;ve ID&#8217;d a pain point. What&#8217;s stopping your product from becoming a commodity? Is it the technology - i.e., is no one able to replicate your product because of IP or trade secrets? Is it network effects? Is it economies of scale?</span></p>
<p><span>Without defensibility, you may still make money, but you&#8217;re going to be competing for scraps with the rest of the market. </span></p>
<p><span>If solving a pain point is why people would buy <em>this</em> product at all, defensibility is why people would continue to buy <em>your</em> product.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Scalability</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span>Scalability, in my mind, is the confluence of two factors: a large potential market and a viable growth model. Consider this: you are the sole owner of wedding photos for a recent wedding. Your potential customers really want to see the photos (pain point) and you&#8217;re the only provider (defensibility). So - you&#8217;ve got the makings of a great product. But, there were 100 people at the wedding, 50 more that didn&#8217;t know but care enough to see the photos, each willing to pay $50 for it. Too bad.</span></p>
<p><span>You fell over because the market was too small.  </span></p>
<p><span>Well what about a big potential market? You can still fall over if you don&#8217;t have a viable growth model to eat up the market. The growth model essentially means that your cost of user acquisition is lower than your customer lifetime value. I&#8217;m sure there are other nuances, but that&#8217;s pretty much it. Even if you solve a problem for someone, if you&#8217;re paying more to deliver the product to them (with &#8220;deliver" meaning everything from the averaged costs of developing the product to creating it to marketing it to supporting it and beyond) than you can receive for it, you don&#8217;t have a viable growth model. </span></p>
<p><span>So if solving a pain point is why people would by this product, and defensibility is why people would buy your product, scalability is why you&#8217;ll be able to create a business around your product.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Concluding thoughts</strong><br /></span></p>
<p><span>So solving a pain point, defensibility, and scalability are all necessary. But are they together sufficient? I haven&#8217;t thought that through, but my hunch is that they are. </span></p>
