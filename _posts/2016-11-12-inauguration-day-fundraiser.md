<em>I sent this email to a group of my friends that live in NYC. If you live in the area and want to help organize, let me know at thomas.vladeck@gmail.com</em>

Friends,

If you're like me you're shocked about what happened on election day. I can't believe our country decided to put that orange-skinned, pussy-grabbing, bankrupt con artist that's likely an agent of the Russian government into the Oval Office.

But here we are.

As bad as it is now, he's not in office yet. And as unpredictable as he is, we have no idea what to expect he'll do when he gets there (<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/uhpo1jrj4nt6d2f/Screenshot%202016-11-12%2011.40.26.png?dl=0">see these two back-to-back tweets as he does a real-time A/B test of governing styles</a>), but it likely won't be good. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/14/politics/newt-gingrich-house-un-american-activities-committee/">One of his top lieutenants already proposed bringing back the House Un-American Activities Committee</a> (a black stain on the history of American Civil Liberties), and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/if-donald-trump-implements-his-proposed-policies-well-see-him-court">if he implements his campaign proposals to remove 11 million immigrants, ban muslims, punish women for having abortions, reinstate waterboarding, and change our libel and slander laws - he'll be violating the first, fourth, fifth, eighth, and 14th amendments</a>.

Not to mention <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-36401174">he's planning to rip up the watershed Paris Accords</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/265895292191248385?lang=en">makes sense as Climate Change is a Chinese hoax...</a>) <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/climate-trends-continue-to-break-records">in a year that has seen every indicator of Global Warming reach dizzying new heights</a>.

While we're on the subject of existential threats, it's becoming clear where the <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/22/michael-morell/experts-say-donald-trumps-policies-dovetail-what-v/">suspiciously pro-Russia policies of the Trump campaign</a> came from, as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/moscow-had-contacts-with-trump-team-during-campaign-russian-diplomat-says/2016/11/10/28fb82fa-a73d-11e6-9bd6-184ab22d218e_story.html">Russian diplomats had been in contact with the Trump campaign throughout</a>. This at a time that <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/nato-ground-troops-high-alert-russia-tensions-baltic-latvia-lithuania-estonia-a7402136.html">NATO has put <b>three hundred thousand</b> ground troops on high alert</a> because of a feared confrontation with Russia.

I don't know about you, but I'm probably going to be a wreck on inauguration day (January 20th). Instead of just watching, let's do something. And that something we should do is <b>party together</b>, raising money for organizations that are going to fight these abhorrences tooth and nail.

Here's what I'm thinking:
<ul>
	<li>We rent out a space</li>
	<li>We invite all our friends</li>
	<li>We have a great time</li>
	<li>Some great groups get some needed cash to keep the fight going</li>
</ul>
Who's in?

Tom
