I've struggled with on-and-off insomnia my whole life. Sometimes I can't fall asleep. Sometimes I can't stay asleep. For months at a time, I will sleep normally, and hope that the issue is behind me. Then, out of nowhere, or sometimes out of somewhere, insomnia will come roaring back. For a week, or sometimes weeks at a time, I will barely sleep. The thought of "it's bedtime, time to get into bed" fills me with anxiety because I know that tonight ain't it. Only when I finally build up a ton of sleep pressure do I know that things will sort themselves out. I just got out of a major insomnia streak, but last night things reverted. Here's hoping they revert back quickly.
