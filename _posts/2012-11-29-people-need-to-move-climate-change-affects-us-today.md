<p>Right after Sandy passed through the East Coast, <a href="http://www.tomvladeck.com/post/34671240064/hurricane-sandy-climate-change-and-market-signals">I wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One area that will be interesting to observe following this Hurricane is the insurance market, as insurers revisit the premia they charge for wind, water, and fire insurance. If they decide that the threat of hurricanes on the highly populated East Coast is higher in a changing or different climate, than the cost to reinsurers to, in turn, insure themselves through catastrophe bonds or other insurance-linked-securities will drive primary market prices higher. Higher premia for these things will send a signal that it is better (all other things equal) to live or develop elsewhere.</p>
