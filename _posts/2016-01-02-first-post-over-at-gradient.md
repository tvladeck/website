At the turn of the new year, I filed paperwork to incorporate <a href="http://gradientmetrics.com" target="_blank">Gradient Metrics</a>, a company with the mission of bringingÂ advanced modeling techniques to more businesses.

I just wrote <a href="http://gradientmetrics.com/2016/01/02/using-random-forests-for-segmentation/" target="_blank">my first blog post over there</a>. Appropriately enough, it's pretty nerdy.
