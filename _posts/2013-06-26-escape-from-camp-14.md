<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0143122916">This book</a> is amazing. I listened to it* recently and I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is a hugely heartwrenching story about a man <strong>born</strong> into a North Korean slave-labor camp - sentenced at birth to a life within the boundaries of a camp, where he would be worked, humiliated, and starved until he ultimately died. The story of everyone else that becomes a prisoner - by birth or otherwise, at one of these camps. But he escaped. The only person to do so. </p>
<p>The book is the story of his life, his escape, and his transformation into a free person. <span>The story is told exceptionally well and is peppered with great detail about North Korea&#8217;s history and current situation. </span></p>
<p>*As an audiobook</p>
