<p>Moved a bunch of states out of the &#8220;safe" categories and into the &#8220;swing state" categories w/ associated prices. States like Indiana, Arizona, Missouri, Michigan, and Wisconsin. (That may in fact be it.)</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t change the outcome whatsoever. So far this race seems safely in the bag for Obama, with this informal model predicting a 97% likelihood of him winning.Â </p>
