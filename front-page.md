Thanks for stopping by!

Go <a href="http://tomvladeck.com/blog/" target="_blank">here</a> for my blog. I post my photos <a href="http://tomvladeck.tv" target="_blank">here</a>, and also on <a href="http://instagram.com/tomvladeck" target="_blank">instagram</a>.

I'm working on a new company called <a href="http://gradientmetrics.com" target="_blank">Gradient</a> to bring advanced mathematical modeling to more businesses, which I started in October 2015 while at Wharton getting my MBA.

In summer '15 I interned at Venmo, which I wrote about <a href="http://blog.venmo.com/2015/9/3/a-marketing-analytics-summer-internship-at-venmo" target="_blank">here</a>. You can find my resume <a href="http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Thomas-Vladeck-29Aug2015.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

In a prior life, I've started a <a href="http://buildinghero.com" target="_blank">company</a>, led the development of a <a href="http://www.thepolicyclimate.org/" target="_blank">large international climate policy project</a>, and recently managed the finance workstream for the <a href="http://newclimateeconomy.net" target="_blank">Global Commission on the Economy and Climate</a>, which was covered in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/16/science/earth/fixing-climate-change-may-add-no-costs-report-says.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21618682-policies-slow-down-warming-may-be-more-attractive-if-framed-ways-speeding-up-growth-try" target="_blank">The Economist</a>, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/16/barack-obama-report-economy-grow-fight-climate-change-un-summit" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-16/fight-against-climate-change-seen-driving-economic-growth.html" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, and got a <a href="https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/511890255348129792" target="_blank">tweet from the President</a>. In a previous role, I brokered several multimillion dollar carbon credit transactions under the Clean Development Mechanism.

I studied math at Pomona College and environmental policy at the London School of Economics. My <a href="http://tomvladeck.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Thesis.pdf" target="_blank">master's thesis</a> explored how markets might price future physical climate risks and shift long-term investments in anticipation of climate change.

I grew up in DC and have been lucky to live in LA, London, San Francisco, Philadelphia and now NYC.

I'm an avid rock climber and photographer. Powered by coffee<b style="color: #252525;">™</b>

<a href="http://files.tomvladeck.com/morality.html" target="_blank">You can see a snapshot of my morality here</a> — bottom line is I seem to care a lot about fairness but not much about authority. Seems right. My <a href="http://files.tomvladeck.com/big_five.htm">big five</a> personality attributes are available here. Very open to experience, slightly neurotic, not very agreeable. Definitely me.
